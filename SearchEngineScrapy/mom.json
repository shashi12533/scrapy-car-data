And while you may face great expenses replacing a damaged radiator, getting an APA a/c temp. switch should be easy and convenient. This switch turns the auxiliary fan on and off according to the coolant temperature. There's usually a pre-set temperature according to the heat the coolant must reach before it requires cooling. When the coolant reaches that temperature, the fan must work to provide proper cooling and keep the coolant from getting so hot. Otherwise, that's when you'll find yourself at the side of the road dealing with all that smoke. Well, a simple switch damage could cause that, so it's important that you get one as reliable as the APA a/c temp. switch. And with that, remember that you need to perform periodic maintenance in your auto's cooling system to monitor wear and tear among various cooling parts. With this guaranteed and the APA a/c temp. switch securely mounted, there's nothing more you can worry about.Feeling unwanted vibrations along the driveline of your auto? You must check the cause of that vibration. Otherwise, you must prepare yourself for a big trouble. That vibration is most likely coming from the rattling of the transmission as it operates with the engine. If you're familiar with the engine's and transmission's operation, you probably know how much forces are involved. And when uncontrolled, these forces can do a lot of damage. Your transmission has a mount that keeps it in place, but that mount isn't enough. You must also have an APA trans. mount bushing installed. Among the transmission problems that may involve the mount or its bushing are louder-than-normal noises in the transmission area, unwanted vibrations, and a shaking shifter. If you ignore these problems, there's a big probability that all the shaking and rattling will cause great damage to the affected components like various transmission parts.

They say that \"a premium exhaust system should, when possible, be used from the start to avoid any premature changes a few years later.\"  APEXi exhaust systems have been engineered extremely well, in contrast to hastily developed systems that have been shown to actually lose power. A'pexi exhaust specialists are among the best in the automotive aftermarket industry, and have helped revolutionize the industry with innovative concepts. They analyze every category of manufacturing including CAD design, materials, exhaust gas dynamics, engine compatibility, welding quality, and real world use. A'pexi's other motto is \"Proven quality outlasts anything else.\" <br>All A'pexi exhaust systems are considered \"direct replacement\" parts because they neither relocate nor modify the required factory emission control devices; therefore they comply with applicable emission laws. They don't require a CARB Executive Order (EO), by virtue of their not being \"add on\" or \"modified\" parts. A'pexi exhaust systems are also \"functionally identical\" to the OEM parts, during emission tests. To ensure compliance with the 95dB limit, A'pexi tests sound levels on stock vehicles before the product release. <br>The A'pexi n1 Muffler series has evolved/  The N1 ExTi (Expert Titanium) offers all of the quality and performance of Apex's race proven N1 Exhaust systems and also incorporates an ultra light weight titanium muffler section. For years, only A'pexi customers in Japan could obtain the N1 Titan; now however, at A'pexiUSA, the company is very pleased to be able to offer this muffler under the N1 ExTi name to the U.S. tuning market. <br>The N1 ExTi utilizes an immaculately constructed Titanium N1 Muffler with full stainless steel piping mated to it. The muffler section discharges through an adjustable length 115mm super heated (burnt) titanium tip and features a full titanium canister. The design of the five step adjustment range of the finisher tip allow users with aero kits the ability to extend or retract the tip in accordance with the dimensions of the rear bumper. The N1 ExTi successfully blending form with function, stands as a true lightweight version of the N1 exhaust.  The A'pexi N1 series muffler is now a standard component of the import tuning industry. The N1 was the first of its kind to incorporate the classic angled muffler design which has thereby, once again, became familiar with street cars today.  Arising from A'pexi' involvement in the grueling N1 endurance series, the N1 exhaust system pairs free flowing, mandrel bent piping (60.5mm N/A, 80mm for turbo applications) with a straight through design racing muffler. This combination resulted in dyno proven horsepower. A'pexi designed it with track use in mind, and with durability as having the utmost importance.  The polished SUS 304 stainless steel canister features robotic TIG welding and yields years of reliable performance and an immaculate finish. A'pexi treats the mild steel piping with a special high temperature titanium particle coating. The A'pexiN1 muffler is truly the benchmark which competitors strive to emulate.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

The common cause is premature wearing of tissues in between bones which makes joint movements painful. Like them, your car's performance can greatly suffer from a damaged acc. shaft coupling. What you need is the AST Acc. Shaft Coupling Kit. The acc. shaft's job is to translate gas pedal movement into throttle valve movement.

Once this happens, flooring the gas pedal may not give you enough acceleration. Other acc. shaft coupling kits do not provide enough flexibility for shaft movement, thus limiting shaft rotation.

That's why you should equip your vehicle with a topnotch Atsugi/Unisia/Paraut auxiliary air valve. This device boosts the engine's power output when the engine isn't fully revved up. Guaranteed to perform more efficiently than OEM auxiliary air valves, this product contains a rotary valve and a bimetallic strip. When your vehicle's engine isn't running on full speed, the bimetallic strip aligns the rotary valve with air hoses in the carburetor. This allows air to pass around the closed throttle and into the carburetor's intake manifold. Once you get the engine fully running again, this air valve's bimetallic strip absorbs heat and closes the valve. Air from the Atsugi/Unisia/Paraut auxiliary air valve helps the engine achieve a higher engine idle speed. And a higher engine idle speed means that the engine generates more power even in an idle state, enough to support various vehicle accessories. Not only that, as long as the Atsugi/Unisia/Paraut auxiliary air valve is connected to the carburetor, you can use the air-conditioning system while your vehicle idles. Just the kind of convenience and functionality you can expect to enjoy when your vehicle uses Astugi/Unisia/Paraut products.Warping and scarring are two of the most common signs of brake disc damage. Warping happens when your vehicle's brake disc reshapes due to exposure to heat. Scarring, on the other hand, occurs when the disc's surface gets scratches from the brake pad's backing plate or rivets. The good news is, whether the damage is warping or scarring, we offer you the quickest, easiest solution: replace the defective brake disc with an Atsugi/Unisia/Paraut brake disc. This aftermarket brake disc is one of your best options if you're looking to replace your vehicle's damaged brake discs. To ensure durability and strength against heat and damage, each set of Atsugi/Unisia/Paraut's brake discs is made from the finest gray iron. The Atsugi/Unisia/Paraut brake disc's surface features strategically-placed holes, to facilitate heat dissipation. These holes also reduce the risks of warping and scarring, without affecting the brake disc's capacities. You definitely can't go wrong with this Atsugi/Unisia/Paraut product. The brand uses advanced engineering and design to ensure that its brake discs outlast their OE counterparts. Each Atsugi/Unisia/Paraut brake disc is also accurately machined to work perfectly with other brake components in your vehicle. So once you discover that your vehicle's brake discs are damaged, don't hesitate to trust Atsugi/Unisia/Paraut.You might not know it, but the Atsugi/Unisia/Paraut cam follower could be just the thing you need to improve your vehicle's performance. Attached to the camshaft, a cam follower is responsible for opening and closing the cylinder head's intake and exhaust valves. A reliable cam follower, like that from Atsugi/Unisia/Paraut, is crucial to the properly-timed transfer of energy and gases in the engine. So when the cam follower gets damaged, the engine's timing is thrown off and misfiring occurs. Fortunately, the Atsugi/Unisia/Paraut cam follower is made to prevent these kinds of engine trouble. This aftermarket cam follower is specifically designed for strength against corrosion and bending. So you don't have to worry about this cam follower succumbing to premature damage. Not only that, this Atsugi/Unisia/Paraut product is also accurately machined for uniform smoothness.  The Atsugi/Unisia/Paraut cam follower sports a lubricated face that helps the cam follower easily trace the valve's surface. The oil-lubricated face also allows the camshaft to move the cam follower according to the engine's timing, with the intake and exhaust valves opening and closing at the right moments. And with the engine's parts running in perfect timing, you can sit back and enjoy hassle-free driving. What could be better than that?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

The engine needs air as well to complete the combustion process. But in order to mix fuel with air, the engine needs to know how warm or cold air is. Just like a mother who computes the budget for her household, the engine computes the right amount of fuel to mix with air depending on its temperature. With the Beru Air Temp. Sensor, your engine will have no problems in coming up with the proper mix. Fuel has higher density than air. That's why cold air-which has the most density-is most ideal to mix with fuel. But when air is warm, the amount of fuel needed is minimized. The Beru Air Temp. Sensor helps keep both ingredients even by providing your engine with exact air temperature readings. It's sensitive enough to detect slight temperature changes anywhere between -40 and +160 degrees Celsius. This way, your engine will be spending the least amount of fuel possible. The end result is maximum engine power at the least fuel cost. So you'll get power when you need it, without sacrificing your car's fuel economy. With the Beru Air Temp. Sensor, you'll have more miles per gallon from a smoother running engine.There's nothing worse than a power outage. Heat builds up inside your house and makes things unbearable for you and your family. The same goes for your engine. Broken aux. fan resistors will cause the auxiliary fan to lose power, leaving immense heat buildup inside your engine. Better replace them right away with the Beru Aux. Fan Resistor. The aux. fan resistor's job is to regulate the flow of electrical power into your auxiliary fan. By limiting the flow of electricity, resistors allow your auxiliary fan to spin at different speeds. However, if the resistors break down, so does your auxiliary fan. And without your auxiliary fan your engine could overheat, causing extensive damage. You'd better invest in the Beru Aux. Fan Resistor to protect your engine from overheating. Beru tests its products in the toughest environment possible - professional racing. It has proven itself countless number of times in the realm of motorsports by supplying almost all teams in the Formula One, the World Rally Championship, the World Touring Car Championship and the Indy Racing League. There simply is no better proof of the durability and performance of Beru products other than endurance in these events. So if you want to keep your engine safe from overheating, keep your auxiliary fan running with the Beru Aux. Fan Resistor.In the old days, people used steam to power their vehicles. Technology back then wasn't advanced enough to make use of electricity in internal combustion. Now, all it takes is the spark from your spark plugs to fire your car's engine. You just have to prevent electricity from flowing elsewhere other than your spark plugs. Control the flow with the Beru Spark Plug Conn. Boot. High-voltage electricity is strong enough to jump across conductors. The best example would be lightning striking a tree in the middle of a field during a storm. If the conn. boots that cover your spark plugs are worn out from heat and corrosion, high-voltage electricity could jump out onto your engine's valve cover. This leaves the affected spark plugs without power and causes your engine to misfire. Your car will have rough idling and acceleration, and poor fuel economy. But don't sweat it. Simply replace your old boots with the Beru Spark Plug Conn. Boot and your engine will be up and running again. Beru continues to prove the quality of its products by enduring the worst possible testing environment - professional racing. In events such as the Formula One, the World Touring Car Championship, the World Rally Championship and the Indy Racing League, only the best suppliers are given the privilege to sponsor racing teams-a privilege Beru has lived up to. That's why with the Beru Spark Plug Conn. Boot, you're guaranteed high heat and corrosion resistance to protect your spark plug connectors.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

Bullet Nerf Bars are frame-mounted steps, which make it easier to climb behind the wheel of these massive vehicles. Unlike previous step systems, however, these Bullet Nerf Bars have aesthetic appeal to many people, and they are often better built. They are made out of 16-guage steel or aluminum rolled into a tube, but there are several different styles of Bullet Nerf Bars. The first Bullet Nerf Bars to come out were straight tubes that ran the length of the door, or doors depending on size, and curved underneath the body a the ends. A flattened-out space on the Bullet Nerf Bars contains steps made of rubber or another non-slip surface. The common finishes for these Bullet Nerf Bars were a 304 stainless steel mirror finish, polished aluminum, chrome, or a black-powder coat. Other Bullet Nerf Bars are straight tubes, available in similar finishes, with matching end caps, and are attached to the body with black powder-coated brackets. Available in both the straight tube and curved-end tube shape, the third style of Bullet Nerf Bars is an oval tube, rather than the circular design. It is made in the same finishes, but these Bullet Nerf Bars provide a wider area to step on. All styles of Bullet Nerf Bars are corrosion resistant, and usually mount easily to the body with no drilling.Bullet Nerf Bars are an attractive alternative to the traditional running board, for ease in climbing into or out of taller vehicles. They have a sporty streamlined appearance that appeals to many who drive larger vehicles, such as pickups and sports utility vehicles. They are stainless steel, or aluminum tube side steps, typically equipped with non-slip step pads. They are often available in a polished mirror finish, a black powder coated finish, or chrome. They are available for most of the pickup trucks and sports utility vehicles that are popularly driven today. They are most commonly available in standard 3-inch diameter, but are also available in a heavy-duty 4-inch diameter. A variation on the round steel tube Bullet Nerf Bar is the oval steel tube version, also equipped with non-slip step pads, and providing a wider, flatter surface to step up on. These are also available in a polished steel, black powder coated finish, or chrome finish. All of these Bullet Nerf Bars typically come with their own mounting brackets, some of which are guaranteed to be weather, salt and rust resistant. Many require no drilling for installation, while some require minimal drilling to install. They are available with vehicle specific mounting kits, made for most popular makes and models of light trucks and SUVs. Professional installation is widely available, however if you are a do-it- yourself person, many of the installation kits are fashioned with you in mind, with simple bolt on mounting systems that require no frame drilling to install.One of the most popular accessories for today's larger vehicles, such as pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, is the Bullet Bar. This is a popular new twist on the traditional running board or step board that make getting in and out of these taller vehicles easier. The Bullet Bar comes in several styles and sizes. For example, they are available in 3 inch, 3.5 inch, or 4 inch diameter tubes. The tubes can be round, or oval for a flatter, wider step area. You can buy them in cab length or wheel-to-wheel style. There are also a variety of materials, and finishes to choose from. They are available in stainless steel, or aluminum, with finishes such as black powder coated paint, mirror polished steel, or chrome plating. The non-slip step pads that are typically featured on these bars vary in size and tread, some designed to channel away rainwater. Most Bullet Bars are vehicle specific, manufactured to fit a particular make and model. This makes installation easier, as the mounting brackets are built to fit your vehicle, and can be often attached without any need for frame drilling. This is very convenient if you are the do-it-yourself type. However, for those who own older or less common vehicles, there may not be a vehicle specific Bullet bar made for your vehicle. In that case, there are universal Bullet Bars available. These universal Bullet Bars may require frame drilling or rocker panels for proper installation.

Why? It saves them from continuous clutch and gear work when driving through urban traffic. However, automatic transmissions need to be lubricated. And if the AT filter o-ring fails, dirt would circulate in the gearbox and may cause it to fail. Better replace that old seal with the CFW/NOK AT Filter O-Ring. You won't really know when it's going to fail. You'll just know once your gears stop working and you smell something burning under your car. That would be your automatic transmission gears succumbing to dirty transmission oil. You have to make sure the AT filter is functioning with the CFW/NOK AT Filter O-Ring.  If left unfixed, soon your transmission will start making noise, and gear-shifting would become harder to manage. The worst thing that can happen is it will overheat because the fluid has become too thick to lubricate the gears. When that happens, your car may get stuck in gear and you'll have to tow it home. Or you could get the CFW/NOK AT Filter O-Ring to fix it. Sometimes, it takes just a small o-ring to avoid major problems.If you suddenly smell something burning under your car, it could be transmission fluid spilling all over your exhaust lines. There's one likely spot where it could be coming from - a leaking AT rear seal. Replace it immediately with the CFW/NOK AT Rear Seal. Automatic transmissions require a lot of lubrication. It protects the gears and shafts inside from friction and excessive heat produced by normal driving. But if the lubricant leaks, friction can damage these parts and eventually cause your transmission to fail. That's why you have to act quickly and change that broken seal with the CFW/NOK AT Rear Seal. A lot of car owners spend hundreds of dollars every year to repair their burned up automatic transmissions. So much money goes to waste for something which could have been avoided early on. It would have been easier if they paid attention to the burning smell from under their cars, or to fluid drops left on their parking spaces. You must not take such symptoms lightly because they warn you of bigger problems in the future. Grab the CFW/NOK AT Rear Seal now. Such a small investment can save you hundreds in repair costs.Black exhaust smoke is always a bad sign. But don't start panicking. If your car starts spewing black smoke, it could still be fixed. All you need is the CFW/NOK Auxiliary Valve Seal. Black exhaust smoke is the result of oil burning in your engine. It could be leaking into the combustion cylinders through broken auxiliary valve seals. These seals are found under your valve cover and are placed over your valve stems. If you leave your engine like this, your car would suffer from poor fuel economy because of the oil that is disturbing the combustion materials. It would also cause engine oil to rapidly decrease, increasing the chances of your engine overheating. Replace broken seals immediately with the CFW/NOK Auxiliary Valve Seal. It will stop oil from leaking into your combustion cylinders. Your fuel will burn cleaner, improving your car's fuel efficiency. No more black smoke would be spewing out of your muffer. With continuous lubrication, your engine won't overheat. You can now sit back and relax, knowing your engine is safe from oil loss and friction damage.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

You've probably noticed that as time passes, it's become increasingly difficult to start it, especially after leaving it parked for a few hours. This is normal for diesel-powered vehicles especially in cold countries. That's because as time passes, the glow plugs in your diesel engine wear out. You're going to have to replace them very soon. But don't settle for cheap OEM glow plugs. Your engine deserves better. Choose the Champion Glow Plug. These plugs will make sure your diesel engine starts in seconds, even during a cold start. What a glow plug does is it basically produces heat in your diesel engine. Diesel, unlike gasoline, does not need the electric spark from a spark plug to ignite it. Instead, it makes use of heat and compression. The pistons in your diesel engine compress air, thus increasing its temperature. Once temperatures are high enough, diesel is injected into the air, instantly burning it. That is where a diesel engine gets its power. However, in cold countries, diesel engines become extremely cold when left parked. That makes it extremely hard for the engine to sustain enough heat to ignite the diesel, making it very hard to start. The solution: Champion Glow Plug. It produces the needed heat during a cold start so the diesel burns smoothly. Don't wait until your glow plugs totally wear out. Or else, it'll take hours to start your engine. Replace them now with the Champion Glow Plug.The life of your car lies in its engine. But without the spark plugs to burn the fuel, it's nothing but a big block of metal. So if you start noticing rough acceleration, idling or even poor fuel economy, those are signs that your spark plugs are starting to wear out. To keep your engine running smoothly, you'll need a good set of spark plugs. Don't just settle for cheap OEM spark plugs. They'll just rob your engine of its true performance. What you need is the Champion Spark Plug. This spark plug has a center electrode with a platinum tip. That means it'll last much, much longer than most OEM brand spark plugs in the market. It produces a strong spark that'll ensure full combustion of the air and fuel mixture in your engine. It's like a give and take relationship - the better the air-fuel mixture burns, the longer your spark plugs will last. And the better the performance of your spark plugs, the better combustion it produces. That is why cheap OEM spark plugs don't last very long. The weak spark they produce leaves unburned fuel which can damage the spark plug. But with the Champion Spark Plug, you get the best of both worlds. You get maximum engine performance - smooth idling and acceleration - plus it will improve your engine's fuel efficiency, keeping your fuel budget manageable. Remember, when it comes to spark plugs, don't be a cheapskate. Invest in the high-quality Champion Spark Plug.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

Aside from regular maintenance procedures like changing your oil, and replacing car fluids here and there, you also need to check on your camshaft oiler kit to make sure that it's properly working and isn't leaking oil anywhere.

Don't compromise your car's performance with an inferior, no-name brand as they may not fit properly or may even damage your precious vehicle. As the camshaft is responsible for regulating the injection of fuel in an engine, it's important that you have a CP-Matic Cam Oiler Kit installed in order for your camshaft to properly and accurately time the injection of vaporized fuel in your engine.

Crane Cams' rocker bodies also feature a lower purshrod seat location, which effectively causes the tip to contact the rocker body at a lower point in the operating arc. The arc travels away from the stud to increase the distance from the pushrod seat to the pivot point, effectively lowering the rocker ratio and boosting your vehicle's performance and response. No other cam manufactures feature this innovative \"Quick Lift\" design.<br>Crane Cams manufactures an entire line of top quality performance accessories for your working vehicle, including Crane cam gears, Crane camshafts, and Crane throttle body spacers.

Trust a replacement Dansk heater valve to provide you the right temperatures inside the car cabin, if that part is what you need.There are many reasons why you should make car maintenance a priority. Aside from government regulations on the quality of the cars on the road, your safety becomes compromised when you drive a time bomb. Car maintenance is something you should never forget about. Since all your car's parts suffer from wear and tear, it is in your best interest to check up on everything on a regular basis. If heaters are not what you need, maybe a Dansk exhaust manifold will do the trick. Different cars have different needs-see what your car's needs are today!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

With regular maintenance you can anticipate and diagnose budding problems. Preventive maintenance beats reparative maintenance any day.

Whether something just does not feel right, or you can hear strange noises or even leaks, you need to get to the source of the problem.

This becomes apparent soon enough for the novice DIY mechanic in you. But there is no way around car maintenance! Either you do it and do it well or you do not do it at all! Another problem comes from haphazard maintenance, which will cause even more problems.

{"link": "<div itemprop=\"articleBody\" data-elemname=\"article_body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>In the past, people didn't have the comfort of air conditioners. In the 1830s, at a hospital found in Florida, people creatively thought of using buckets of ice behind fans in order to blow cool air to the patients. It was only in 1902 that the idea of creating an air conditioning device came to American engineer and inventor, Willis Carrier. He called his air conditioner, the 'Apparatus for Treating Air'. From then on, other inventors started inventing their own versions of air conditioners for buildings, houses, and eventually for cars. That's why today, with the push of a button, or turn of a knob, you can enjoy the advantages of having air conditioning inside your home, office, and of course inside your car. And with Egelhof, known experts in producing top-quality expansion valves for your car's air conditioner, you can be sure to keep the cool inside your car.</p>You see, air conditioning, like it says, 'conditions' air. This device cools the air down and decreases the amount of moisture present in it. The air conditioner has a lot of components that help regulate the temperature inside your car's cabin. And this includes your Egelhof expansion valve. Basically, this part of you're A/C unit is a pressure-regulator that works hand-in-hand with the receiver dryer, getting highly-pressurized refrigerant from it and turning the refrigerant into low-pressure vapors for the evaporator.Using a sensing bulb connected to the expansion valve, this part can sense both temperature and pressure. And to regulate refrigerant flow, the valve removes the pressure from the liquid refrigerant coming from the receiver dryer and turns it into cold low-pressure vapors. The vapors then are passed to the evaporator to be vaporized and the heat from the passenger compartment is absorbed. Finally, the blower fan inside the cabin pushes air over the outside of the evaporator to circulate cool air. So when the expansion valve becomes clogged with debris, or when small parts of the valve corrode, the air conditioning system can malfunction entirely. That's why for top-notch expansion valves, you can get them from the world-class brand Egelhof.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

In 1938, Harald Nielsen, then a young engineer, recognized the need for top-quality gaskets and established 'Harald Nielsens Pakningsfabrik'.

And with 40 other top brands that count on the advantage of having durable gaskets in their engines, steering system, and suspension systems, this product can definitely be tagged world-class.</p>Gaskets serve as mechanical seals that fill the gap between two surfaces in regular contact to prevent leakage or to reduce the amount of friction so that parts that rub against or are linked to each other can move  with greater ease. There are many types of gaskets, but the ones used by most cars are made of metal or rubber. Metal gaskets are often used between parts of your car closest to the engine. This is because metal gaskets are more tolerant of extreme temperatures, not to mention the fact that metal gaskets can expand and contract with the surfaces it seals. One example of a metal gasket that Elring makes is the head gasket found between the engine block and the cylinder head.On the other hand rubber gaskets are used most of the time on movable areas. Your car's suspension parts, like your steering link and control arms, use rubber gaskets to prevent these parts from prematurely corroding because of friction. Elring rubber gaskets are compression fit so they won't ever loosen up.

For your engine, proper timing is important too in order to combust fuel for your car to work. That is why, as a vehicle owner, you have to make sure that your ride's fuel injectors and spark plugs are in perfect tune with each other.

And this is the reason why you should have a top-performing camshaft from Engine Power so that your engine will more than adequately receive the proper amount of fuel necessary for it to run.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

The technology of VTEC is pretty simple. It automatically lowers valve lift at low engine rpm (revolutions per minute) to save fuel, while increasing it at high rpm to match the performance of a racing engine. VTEC basically delivers power throughout the engine's rpm band. Now, for those of you whose cars don't run a VTEC engine, but want to be able to 'dial' (shift at different rpm) the power of your engine, then the Fidanza Camshaft Gear is what you need. It allows you to dial in your engine to match your own driving style or habits. You can adjust it by as much as 24 degrees, either to advance or retard the camshaft timing. Advancing it will give you low rpm power, which is great for city driving, while retarding it will give you power in higher rpm, similar to a racing engine. And with its beveled tooth edges, your timing belt or chain doesn't easily wear out on the Fidanza Camshaft Gear. The adjusting studs, nuts and lock-washers are all made of hardened stainless steel to keep from loosening at high engine speeds. If you're looking to turn your normal stock ride into a racing machine, this should be first on your shopping list. Have the ability to dial in your engine just like professional racers with the Fidanza Camshaft Gear.On June 21, 2008, two-time National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) drag champion Scott Kalitta was fatally injured during a qualifying round of the NHRA Powerade Drag Racing Series. Since then, both drag racing officials and teams have worked hand in hand to make the sport a lot safer. But it will never erase the fact that something went wrong during that fateful day. Kalitta's engine exploded and his brakes could not stop his drag car. Why- Because the clutch failed, thus his wheels kept spinning. This is to illustrate the danger of a broken clutch cable. Upgrading to the Fidanza Clutch Cable will ensure this kind of incident never happens to you. Professional racers swear by Fidanza's quality clutch parts. Drivers of no less than Mitsubishi Lancer Evolutions and Subaru Imprezas have tried and tested these products. Their findings- They can't find anything wrong with it! You should take note that these cars are all-wheel drives, which demand high torque on all four wheels in racing conditions. And yet, they find no change or difference in the way their clutch pedals feel since day one. Imagine what it can do to your car. With the Fidanza Clutch Cable, you'll never be afraid of the clutch failing on you... ever. Whether you're competing in a national drag competition, at a circuit event, or just plain drifting on parking lots or empty streets, your clutch will keep kicking no matter what. Listen to the professionals. Upgrade to the Fidanza Clutch Cable now!In the world of racing, there lies a big difference between grip driving and drifting. In grip driving, as in Formula One, your car's as stable as possible while cornering. In drifting, as in Formula Drift, the point is to create enough oversteer to make your car's tail slide, which means you have to intentionally throw off its balance. According to the millions of drifters worldwide, it's tons more fun than grip driving. But here's the catch- it wears down your clutch much faster than in grip. So if you're into drifting, make sure you invest in the Fidanza Clutch Kit. There are a lot of quality clutch kits out there, but none as enduring or as professionally recognized as Fidanza's. Sure, there's the ultra-expensive Exedy clutch kits. But why would you spend so much if you can get the same durability and performance at less cost- If you're scoping the market for a professional clutch kit that's well within your money's reach, then this is it. It doesn't matter whether your engine is a V6 or a V10. This clutch will grip that flywheel at whatever engine speeds you're running. The Fidanza Clutch Kit is designed with the passionate racer in mind. Whether you're into drag, circuit or hardcore drifting, this kit will keep performing right from day one. No matter how many laps you've done, you won't get a change in clutch pedal feel. That's professional quality right there. You'll be burning tires with the Fidanza Clutch Kit.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

{"link": "<div itemprop=\"articleBody\" data-elemname=\"article_body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Performance, reliability and style are not the only things Flexalite provide you; it has more to do with practicality.</p><p>Be the first to achieve lasting engine performance and lasting impression with products created by no less than Flexalite.</p><p>Entrust your vehicle to no other than Flexalite automotive parts that could achieve engine performance and keep it going.</p><p>One look at the marque of Flexalite on an automotive component and you know there is nothing above it.</p>Almost all complex electronic devices require a cooling fan to be able to drive away the excessive heat created as a by-product of the use of forms of energy.  As for automotive applications, the Flexalite electric cooling fan is tasked to bring down the engine temperature once the heat energy resulted from the internal combustion processes has taken its toll on the metal engine components.  Too much heat in the engine compartment could affect the functionality and work of the engine system which is why there is a need for a Flexalite electric cooling fan to have something to address this problem.  The Flexalite electric cooling fan is an integral component of any engine cooling system that comprises an air cooling system and liquid cooling system.  In an engine cooling system, it is the Flexalite electric cooling fan that obtains power from the car battery whenever the thermostat detects a significant rise in the engine temperature.  The Flexalite electric cooling fan works in the same way as all types of electric fans and is designed to circulate the cool air that has entered the engine compartment through the grille.  Every Flexalite electric cooling fan is made up of a fan blade, a fan clutch, a fan shroud and a fan motor that together control the operation of the cooling fan.  One thing that the Flexalite is ideally designed for is to avoid the re-circulation of air to prevent feeding the radiator hot air which cannot help in the cooling process.Want to maximize the efficiency of the engine cooling system?  Complete the Flexalite electric cooling fan assembly including the Flexalite fan clutch and the Flexalite fan blade.  Never ending demands for great horsepower, torque, speed and acceleration could leave the engine working hard to meet such difficult task.  In order to achieve your demands, the engine system undergoes internal combustion processes to convert fuel into a form of energy that could power your ride, and as a result, thermal energy builds up on the metal engine components.  Without anything to drive away the heat, your engine will eventually stop working unless some mechanism is used to bring the engine temperature back to normal.  Thankfully, the engine cooling system has been revised and refined to drive away the heat in the engine compartment.  The Flexalite fan blade may appear to you as small and insignificant, but without it, the engine cooling system will never be able to achieve its purpose of maintaining the normal engine temperature.  The engine cooling processes start when the thermostat detects a relative increase in engine temperature which in turn alerts the engine management system to start the cooling process before engine overheat takes over.  The Flexalite fan blade is a significant device in the cooling fan which is designated to circulate the cool air that has entered the area under the hood to cool the then hot coolants.  Make sure that the fan blade in your auto bears the mark of Flexalite to guarantee excellent service.Tired of engine overheat incidents that piss you off?  Invest in a Flexalite fan clutch that could ascertain ideal operation of the electric cooling fan in the engine's all important cooling system.  If you want to be assured of the efficiency of the cooling fan in bringing down the engine temperature, you would want to complete the set of Flexalite electrical cooling fan which is a trusted brand by wise and practical car owners.  The Flexalite fan clutch is a tiny fluid combined with a thermostatic mechanism that regulates the movement of the electric cooling fan which can be operated under different speeds.  By making sure that the electric cooling fan will operate at the appropriate speed, the Flexalite fan clutch is able to lessen the likeliness of an engine overheat.  Once the engine is already cooled down, it is the Flexalite fan clutch that turns off the cooling fan.  Contained in the Flexalite fan clutch is a fluid coupling partially packed with silicone oil to perform its task.  Once the temperature in the radiator starts to rise, a bimetal coil spring in the fan clutch is engaged to expand.  The expansion of the coil means that greater amount of oil is allowed to get inside the fluid coupling to start the rotational motion of the cooling fan.  After the temperature surrounding the radiator starts to lower, the coil spring in the Flexalite fan clutch compresses for the oil to leave the fluid coupling and stop the cooling fan's rotation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

The clutch slave cylinder is directly link to the manual transmission casing. This is also the reason why when the clutch pedal is pressed, the pressure generated by clutch master cylinder is applied to the clutch slave cylinder. This then results to the clutch disengaging. The clutch master cylinder is responsible for operating the clutch assembly by means of generating hydraulic pressure. On the other hand, the clutch assembly has two basic functions and these are: to transmit power generated by the engine to the gearbox and to interrupt the flow of power whenever the clutch is depressed. Unfortunately, prolonged usage of the vehicle can damage the clutch slave cylinder and the clutch master cylinder. Once this happens, replacement parts are going to be required. High quality replacements such as the FTE clutch slave cylinder and FTE clutch master cylinder are the best options.In terms of the brake master cylinder, its function is to hold the fluid that initiates the operation of the entire braking system. Highly pressurized hydraulic brake fluid activates the pistons and the brake calipers once the brake pedal is depressed. To ensure that there is always a sufficient supply of brake fluid the brake master cylinder make sure that the fluid is tightly contained in place. But just like the rest of components in the vehicle, the brake master cylinder also wear out and a topnotch FTE brake master cylinder can help you fixed it.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

A vehicle part is developed based on needs this is also the case with the radiator hose. You see in the past, automotive engineers were trying to figure out ways on how they will be able to get the engine coolant from the engine to the radiator and back again. They needed to come up with a part that will be able to flow freely without affecting moving parts like the pullies for the fan belts. Moreover, the conduit that they need must be durable enough to resist the vibration of the engine and must perfectly fit the neck of the radiator that when the fluid flows through it, it will not shake loose. They came up with a molded rubber hose that connects the thermostat housing, the water pump, the inlet neck of the radiator at the top, and the radiator's outlet neck at the bottom.

Those of you who fall into the first category are probably looking at Goldline springs to reduce the wheelwell gap after fitting big tires and wheels. You're in for a pleasant surprise: Not only will Goldline springs drop your car by up to several inches, but you won't lose your comfortable ride in the process. Goldline springs utilize progressive rate technology so the springs stay soft while you're cruising and don't firm up until you get down to business. You guys in the second category probably perked up when you heard progressive rate. That's racing technology, and its found on all Goldline springs. If you race your car on weekends but still have to get to the office on Monday morning, you don't want to be bouncing all over the interstate on harsh competition springs. Goldline springs give you the best of both worlds by firming up when you're cornering hard but staying compliant in everyday driving. All Goldline springs are precision engineered to fit each application perfectly, and high carbon spring steels are used in all Goldline springs for strength and durability. It's performance you can count on, year in and year out, when you choose Goldline springs for your car.You're probably already familiar with the difference a set of performance shocks can make on your ride and handling, but did you know Goldline coil springs can make an even larger change in your ride quality? The shocks do the work of damping spring motion, but your springs are what's in charge of holding your ride off the ground. Goldline coil springs work a little differently compared to your factory springs by offering progressive rate design. What that means is that as your Goldline coil springs compress, they become firmer. During normal, level driving, Goldline coil springs are as soft as factory coils, but as soon as you cut into a corner and begin to apply pressure to the suspension, Goldline coil springs firm up fast giving you extra support through the twisties. All Goldline coil springs are made from premium hardened spring steels for long life without sag, and the gold finish will look great inside your wheelwellsif anyone can see them. That's because Goldline coil springs are also available in several heights to lower your ride by as much as 2. If you have big wheels and tiresand the resulting big gap in your fendersGoldline coil springs will bring things back into line. You get a great look and great performance, all from one great product: Goldline coil springs.Your 20 wheels looked great in the store, and with those low-profile Toyos they should really make your ride pop. But now that you've got them on, something's not quite right: There's too much room between the tires and your car's body. You need Goldline lowering springs to bring that gap down a little. Goldline lowering springs are precision parts designed to replace your factory springs and lower your vehicle by as much as 2 inches. By removing that much spring travel, you're probably thinking your ride is going to deteriorate, but since Goldline lowering springs use a progressive rate mechanism, you don't need to worry. Goldline lowering springs are soft for the first few centimeters of travel, then firm up rapidly. As a result, you get a smooth ride on level surfaces and over bumps, but as soon as you start carving up the corners, your Goldline lowering springs get into the game and keep you in line. In fact, Goldline lowering springs give you a smoother ride in normal situations and a firmer ride in hard drivinghow's that for the best of both worlds? So don't put up with that goofy gap when installing larger wheels and tiresthat's not the look you wanted. Get the aggressive rake you've been gunning for and all around better handling too with a set of Goldline lowering springs.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

{"link": "<div itemprop=\"articleBody\" data-elemname=\"article_body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Granatelli hot rod legend now applies to your fuel injected car, since you can get high tech sensors and components for your ride</p><p>A Granatelli mass air flow sensor acts like a larger throttle body for your car, allowing more air into the system</p><p>Granatelli MAF sensors are regulated to work with high-flow cold air intake systems, keeping your car's computer happy</p><p>Don't bore out a stock MAF sensor: Upgrade to a Granatelli MAF sensor to ensure proper functioning in your injection system</p>Times are a changin' when we start talking about the high performance Granatelli mass air flow sensor. It used to be carburetors, then we stepped up to throttle bodies, and now there's a Granatelli mass air flow sensor to replace your slow, stock sensor. We were skeptical at first, but after seeing an additional 10-23 horsepower, we decided to take a close look at the Granatelli mass air flow sensor. Like a larger throttle body, the Granatelli mass air flow sensor improves power in part by flowing more air than its stock counterpart. Smoother ductwork, fewer restrictions, and a larger bore size all contribute to this additional airflow on the Granatelli mass air flow sensor. However, the electronics used in a Granatelli mass air flow sensor are also improved over the stock unit. Since a Granatelli mass air flow sensor is specifically calibrated to your car's engine and improved components are used, the Granatelli mass air flow sensor is actually able to respond to changes in throttle position and airflow much more quickly than a stock sensor. The result is that you get faster acceleration, vastly improved midrange performance, and all with no loss in idle quality. The Granatelli mass air flow sensor is even 50 state legal, so check them out and pick one up for your vehicle.r works and what it does? Well, for fuel injection systems like most of us have nowadays, the more information sent to the computer the better. The Granatelli MAF sensor (for mass air flow) lets the computer know just how much air is streaming in the intake duct. You know all those fancy cold air intakes you've been experimenting with? Well the Granatelli MAF sensor lets your car's computer know how much air you're adding, and how much the engine is pulling in. The thing is, a factory mass airflow sensor is only so bigin other words, there's a finite amount of air you can pull through it, limiting your potential power. A Granatelli MAF is bored larger than factory so your theoretical maximum power output increases. Now before you get the wise idea to take a Dremel tool to your factory MAF sensor, keep in mind that the Granatelli MAF is calibrated to work specifically with it's diameterjust like your factory sensor. Drill it out and you're asking for a check engine light to join you for the drive. Upgrade to a Granatelli MAF sensor instead and increase airflow the right way. Coupled with a cold air intake and an enlarged throttle body, a Granatelli MAF sensor can really add a lot of air to the system.Complete mastery of your electronic fuel injection systemand your electronic ignition and transmissionis as close as the Granatelli Predator programming device. Stop suffering at the mercy of factory engine settings. You're not your grandmother, so why should you have to drive a car calibrated for her. The Granatelli Predator plugs right in to your computer diagnostic port and opens up a whole world of tuning options for you. You can set fuel and ignition curves with the Granatelli Predator to take advantage of the aftermarket speed gear you've installed. You can customize shift points in your computer controlled automatic transmission thanks to the Granatelli Predator. Heck, the Granatelli Predator can even adjust the temperatures at which your electric cooling fans come on. That's a lot of power, and a lot of power is what you can see at the rear wheels courtesy of your Granatelli Predator. But what happens when you're having car trouble, rather than looking to improve horsepower? The Granatelli Predator makes itself invaluable here too. You just plug the Granatelli Predator into the OBD port and it lets you view, scan, and delete trouble codes stored in your car's computer. You can diagnose your problem with the Granatelli Predator, fix it, then get back to using your Granatelli Predator to drop your quarter mile times. Now that sounds like a good use for a computer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

This manufacturer from San Francisco is new in the field, but its experienced owners and employees came together out of the need to make door handles for trucks that were both stylish and useful. After seeing a lot of trucks with plastic door handles that were less than stellar-handles that broke down easily and didn't match the vehicles' styles-the people behind Grippen Billet decided that something had to be done.So, Grippin Billet made over 50 product ideas molded from billet steel, which was definitely a tougher material compared to what passed for normal door handle material.

You see, the vehicle's axle provides the necessary power coming from the transmission to the drive wheels. But the axle has one weak point-its CV joint's boots. Constant velocity joints allow the axle to bend while the vehicle is turning. And when the CV joint's boots wear, grease coming from the axle leaks out. And this can cause your axle and the joint to tear each other apart because lost of lubrication. That's why GSP North America provides premium quality CV boots, CV joints, and axles when you've given up on your old parts.</p>It's a pain to know that eventually after around 150,000 miles, your CV joints and axles will need to be replaced. And it's even alarming to hear that you may get into an accident if you leave your CV boots unchecked. So when you feel that you're having a hard time moving your steering wheel and when you hear clunking or knocking sounds while turning, it means that your axle is grinding into your CV joints. And this is caused by worn CV boots causing grease that lubricates the CV joint and the axle to leak out. Eventually rust can form around the area where the CV joint and the axle connect causing these parts to wear down prematurely. And you might not be able to prevent this from happening if you just replace your CV boots with that of other brands.That's why you should get reliable replacements for your CV boots, CV joints, and axles-one possible source is GSP North America.

Your car's antenna is designed to receive these radio waves and send them to your radio. Without a working car antenna, you won't be able to tune in to your favorite FM station. That's why it has been the work of Harada to provide car companies, auto part suppliers, and customers with durable and functional car antennae. Harada was established in Tokyo, Japan in 1957 and has gained a remarkable reputation because of its top-notch antennae enough to be recognized by the world.</p>The principle of the car antenna is simple-to receive radio waves and send them to the radio to be amplified so you can hear the transmission perfectly. But depending on the design, there are plenty of different ways to capture radio waves better. That's why Harada makes sure that all their car antennae are made out of materials that can collect radio waves for a clear reception. With their \"lock-antenna\", a specialized antenna designed for cars, they became a world-class antenna provider with a wide market niche.But cars are not their only business. In order to keep up with the world's demand in communication's technology, the company involved itself in the creation of various mobile phones, PHS base stations, and wireless LAN. Harada established its biggest research and development center at the University of Kent, England to be able to meet the requirements of current and future technologies allowing the company to concentrate on developing new ideas away from intellectual thieves.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

Since water is one of our sources of life, you'd at least expect it to be clean whenever you drink it, right? Well, vehicles expect the same thing, too. But instead of clean water, they enjoy taking in clean oil and fuel. It's because of this need that Hastings has been around for quite some time now. Specializing in developing various filters, the company has dedicated itself in providing only the best oil and fuel filters for today's vehicles.<br>So how does Hasting do it? For fuel filters, it eliminated what was once a standard in the component: plastic bowl separators. Since they're considered road hazards, susceptible to leaks, and difficult to replace, the company decided that its fuel filter can do away with them. In its place, Hastings incorporated the use of a metallic self-venting drain. Thanks to this new feature, drivers can now say goodbye to messy leaks and the hassles of replacing these plastic bowls. Aside from eliminating inconveniences, this new feature allows fuel to flow freely. For its oil filters, the company has used heavy-duty cans with metallic end caps and base plates for added durability and strength. The company also focused its attention of having in its oil filters high-quality rubber seals and nitrile gaskets to effectively keep dirt out and stop leaks. Lastly, Hastings inserted a unique anti-drainback valve into the fold, which enables its oil filter to contain the oil and keep it from escaping. Too, this helps in preventing engine knocks and engine wear.<br>When it comes to oil and fuel filtration, trust only Hastings to get the job done. By combining unique technology with in-depth testing and analysis, it's able to provide car owners with products that enhance the performance of their cars.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

In the old days of performance exhaust making, engineers weld up pipes until they find the right concoction for more power and torque.

This lets the engine focus on sending horsepower to the rear wheels, not on pushing exhaust gases out the tailpipe.<p></p>There is a Hedman Hedder available for every car. Sport compacts, imports, trucks, or muscle cars from the States are readily available in stores. For the budget-conscious, there's the black-painted Hedman Headers.

From engine parts to other system parts like your exhaust and intake systems and transmission systems, gaskets play a vital role in sealing off those elements that make your car work efficiently. That's why it is necessary to have top-notch quality gaskets, and Hebmuller has an array of gasket sets that you can use to replace your wearing ones.</p>You might have heard of Hebmuller because it has been in existence since Josep Hebmuller founded the company in 1889. Back then, it manufactured bodies of cars notable for building a two-seater convertible based on the Volkswagen Type 1 known as the Volkswagen Type 14A. But in the 1940s, the economy was not doing so well because of the Great Depression. It was also around this time that the company suffered from a massive fire forcing the management to declare bankruptcy. But now, the company has returned stronger, choosing to specialize in high-performance gaskets for automatic transition vehicles which not only cater towards their former German car company client but also to other car manufacturers as well.Why the transition to gaskets? You see, a vehicle has a lot of gaskets in it. At least one gasket is working for every system of your ride. There's the cylinder head gasket, transmission pan gasket, oil pan gasket, and a lot more. Gaskets are important sealing mechanisms that ensure vital liquids are properly circulated (in the case of transmission pan gaskets), for air to be taken in (intake manifold gaskets) and exhaust gases to be taken out (exhaust manifold gaskets). And this is a great opportunity for Hebmuller to profit from a much-needed demand. This brand ensures that surfaces that often come into contact in your vehicle will be locked together without leaks, ensuring better engine performance on the road.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

That's why the Korean brand Heliolite considers halogen bulbs as a big business because they know that the car drivers need brighter and longer-lasting lights.</p>You see, a halogen bulb is a type of incandescent bulb that functions and looks similar to traditional light bulbs. But the main difference between an incandescent bulb and a halogen bulb is that the former lasts 750 to 1,250 hours while the latter lasts between 2,000 to 2,500 hours. And because halogen lamps use tungsten filaments that produce high temperatures of heat, these bulbs produce a brighter and clearer glow. Also, halogens bulbs use up to 50 percent less electricity compared to light bulbs. And these factors are greatly valued by the world's top automobile manufacturers; that's why they install halogen lights in their first-class vehicles. So, Heliolite saw this opportunity and made sure they were able to create halogen lights that would pass the standards of manufacturers like Audi, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes Benz, and Volkswagen among others.The Lumiko Heliolite Company was founded in 1998 in Korea to provide automotive halogen bulbs, and using its international sales office in New Jersey, this company has succeeded in garnering the trust of many markets, primarily that of the US.

Compared to other types of tapes, the Hushmat butyl tape is made of rubber that provides great adhesion to virtually all objects, among them metal, wood, glass, zinc and concrete.  Unlike other tapes, the Hushmat butyl tape is found to stand a greater chance against the effects of heat and cold that could wear off the adhesive material.  With Hushmat butyl tape, you are assured that the two objects you stuck together through the Hushmat butyl tape will not separate even when exposed to extreme weather conditions.  With its excellent dielectric insulation, you are guaranteed that the Hushmat butyl tape is safe to use even in putting together conductors without getting yourself electrified even if you have only actually touched the tape.  The Hushmat butyl tape lasts longer than any type of adhesives because of its ability to resist corrosion when exposed to moisture, steam and water.  Considering the great adhesion of the Hushmat butyl tape, you might be surprised to learn that it can be easily applied for any technical application it can serve.  This may sound absurd to you, but the Hushmat butyl tape is actually imbued with great opposition to harmful ultraviolet rays.  This is made possible due to the aluminum coat that could seem unaffected when exposed to bright and direct sunlight.If you are planning to upgrade the audio system in your vehicle or you want to protect the expensive audio system already installed in your vehicle, you might want to seal in the interior cabin from outside noise and vibratory motions, timbre or clattering of the sheet metal panels that are brought about by tuning in to specific frequencies.  To install a Hushmat sound dampening material is all you have to do to address this problem.  Having a Hushmat sound dampening material for your vehicle need not be expensive and tiring, and is actually easy that even a novice can finish it within a few minutes.  What you have to prepare in advance is a knife, glue, hair dryer, roller, acetone and old rags to get you ready to install a Hushmat sound dampening material.  In most cases, you have to expose the Hushmat sound dampening material to sunrays for it to get all warmed up.  By doing so, you can easily manipulate the Hushmat sound dampening material and make it more flexible.  Installing a Hushmat sound dampening material may require you to strip the trunk carpet, car floor carpet, seats, dash and the inner door panels.  You have to clean the metal with the use of acetone before spraying glue.  After this, you can already apply the Hushmat sound dampening material. Test with the use of the roller whether the Hushmat sound dampening material has already stuck to the surface before heating it with the use of hair dryer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},
{"link": "<div itemprop=\"articleBody\" data-elemname=\"article_body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>A sealant is a gluey material that changes its state to solid once applied. It is used to prevent the passage of gas, noise, air, dust, fire, smoke, and liquid to the part that it seals or protects. Normally, sealants are used to close small holes or materials that are hard to cover. For the engine the ideal sealant to use is one that is resistant from corrosion, insoluble, and highly adhesive. Furthermore, the engine sealant should also be able to withstand the high temperature in the engine. IDC is a renowned manufacturer of engine sealants and one of the best in the world.</p>The IDC engine sealant does not only repair engine blocks but seals specific parts of the engine enabling it to continuously perform. Sealants are usually made from an array of materials such as plastic, rubber, silicone, foam, and other metallic-based components. The engine sealant is usually in a liquid form to fill in cracks in the engine and dries up or hardens once the engine heats up. An engine sealant is an inexpensive way of fixing cracks or small holes in the engine however it is important to understand that a sealant is only a temporary remedy just to give you time to prepare for the major repair.In order to start using the IDC engine sealant you need to first drain the water and coolant from the radiator. You need to ensure that no liquid will flow to the engine while you are applying the sealant. This is because sealant doesn't work well on wet surfaces aside from that the coolant or anti-freeze hinders the sealant from hardening properly.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

{"link": "<div itemprop=\"articleBody\" data-elemname=\"article_body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The secret to having a perfectly functioning vehicle is to be fully aware of the various components that comprise it, their functions, and what damages these components. With this knowledge, you would be able to solve any problems in your vehicle that would arise. One of the components in your vehicle that you need to understand is the brake drum. It is one of the major components of the braking system that helps to slow down or stop a vehicle in motion. Ikuta is a renowned brand of brake drum. The brake drum is usually in the form of a rotating wheel. In order for this component to work properly it needs for its various components to be on their tiptop condition. The components comprising the brake drum include brake shoes, adjuster mechanism, emergency brake mechanism, piston, and springs.</p>Once brakes are applied, brake fluid is forced to the wheel cylinder which in turn pushes the brake shoes against the machined surface on the inside of the drum. When the pressure is released the springs return and pull the shoes back to the original position. Unfortunately, hard braking could increase the diameter of the drum which could lead to brake fade and then brake failure when not repaired immediately. A metal to metal sound is an indication that the brake drums are already worn out. If you want to enjoy longer usage of your brake drums then purchase only Ikuta brake drum.Ever wondered why despite the popularity of disk brakes, drum brakes are still employed by some auto manufacturers? Cost is the reason. Drum brakes are cheaper to produce for the rear wheels as compared to disk brakes. The other reason is the parking brake system wherein if drum brakes are employed it involves only the addition of a lever as compared to disk brakes where a complete mechanism is required.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

The air filter cleanses the air before it gets sucked into the engine. You see air is required to start the combustion process. Contaminated air meaning with air particles such as dirt, moisture, etc are hard to burn unlike clean air. It also puts extra burden to the engine during combustion.</p>Aside from the effect on the engine performance there is also the hazard to the health of a vehicle's occupants. Results of studies have shown that occupants are more at risk of inhaling dangerous air pollutants inside a vehicle's cabin as compared to pedestrians and public transfer riders. Knowing this makes it even more vital to ensure that the air filter of your vehicle is not yet worn out. Choosing a high quality brand of air filter such as the Interfil air filter can help in making sure that all the contaminants the needs filtering are effectively being filtered out.The fuel separator is another important component that affects the performance of the vehicle. It is basically a fuel bowl with a separating filter mounted inline. The fuel enters and fills the separator. If there is water in the fuel it separates out and remains at the bottom of the filter. The separator continues to separate the water from the fuel until the filter becomes full of water. When this happens, the separator becomes ineffective thus allowing water to leak to the fuel into the carburetor or the injection system. A new fuel separator is therefore required. When it comes to high quality fuel separator replacement you can count on Interfil fuel separator.

The distributor cap also carries with it a high amount of voltage making it at risk of getting damage. There are obvious signs of damage to the distributor that will tell you whether its time to replace it or not and these are excessive carbon buildup or dirt, presence of fire damage, broken terminal, and cracks or breakage on the cap. Once you see any of these signs, make sure that you immediately change the distributor cap to avoid further damage to your vehicle.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

This is where sway bars come in. Without sway bars, cornering will be very hard for you. A sway bar couples the suspensions on each side to each other and relative to the chassis. It also increases the spring rate depending on the side that is compressed the most thus making the car more level or more stable.</p>To aid the sway bar in its function is the sway bar bushing. It is made of rubber, urethane or polyurethane. The sway bar is mounted to the center of the bushing and at its exterior is a bracket that connects it onto the chassis. The size of the bushing depends on the size of the sway bar and can size up to 2 inches in diameter. There are different materials used for the bushing. All these materials are designed to withstand extreme heat and temperature and minimize friction. Unfortunately, prolonged usage can still lead to the wearing of the bushing hence, replacement is still required. JCC sway bar bushing provides an excellent replacement if you want to enjoy longer bushing lifespan. It is a product of JCC, which is a brand renowned worldwide for its superior sway bar bushings and strut rod bushings.Speaking of strut rod bushing, these are polyurethane components that reduce common wheel roll-under. This occurs when a vehicle stop abruptly especially in the case of performance tires. Both front and rear-wheel-drive vehicles are equipped with strut rod bushings. The increased usage of performance and higher traction tires on today's vehicles has made its toll on the soft original factory strut rod bushings. This usually causes the steering axis to slant excessively and to result to unwanted alignment movement that leads to premature failure and wearing of the lower control arm bushings. JCC strut rod bushing can help eradicate excessive steering axis changes as well as diminish wheel hop and traction loss. While accomplishing all these, the JCC's strut bushing is still able to allow the suspension to perform smoothly and at its optimum without resulting to binding.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

Shaft seal is just one part of the three-part system together with the shaft and the housing into which the seal is installed. Mechanical assemblies particularly those containing fluids are designed to allow the passage and distribution of fluids. During such process, it is vital for these assemblies not to leak or they failed in their purpose. To aid these assemblies in their function, seals are incorporated to prevent leakage especially at the points where different assembly parts connect or mate. The space between these assemblies are called clearance gap. The purpose of the seal is to block the clearance gap in order to prevent fluids from leaking through it.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

To correct this problem, you need a top-notch tensioner like the Koyo Belt Tensioner, which will make your belt spin tight. This premium tensioner will also protect your pulleys from damage, silence any squealing noises in your serpentine belt system and keep the power flowing from your battery.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

It's not uncommon for the gasket to come loose due to external forces or because of the accumulated effects of wear and tear. If you can smell nasty exhaust gases when you open your hood, that's another sign you should replace the bad gasket immediately. But to make sure your next gasket holds tighter and lasts much longer than the one you just blew out, install a KP Exhaust Gasket.</p>KP is one of the most trusted manufacturers of auto parts in the industry. Its high-quality gaskets are used by motorists all over the country to keep their vehicles leak-free and working as efficiently as possible. One of their products that you must definitely try is the KP Manifold Gasket, which will increase your fuel efficiency like never before. There are two types of manifold gaskets in most cars: the intake and exhaust manifold gaskets. If you've never replaced any of these gaskets, then one of them could be the culprit to the leak in your exhaust system.Another common site of leak is the timing cover gasket, which fastens the timing cover to the engine block. Without a tightly sealed gasket, pollutants will gain entry to the system and the timing chain and gears will lose lubrication. So if your car's timing cover gasket is clearly out of shape, replace it with a premium KP Timing Cover Gasket made of high-strength materials for extra durability and flexibility. With this gasket on, you'll never have to worry about leaks for years.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

You're bound to get stuck in the middle of the highway with steam rising up from under the hood. If you don't want to be at the mercy of the tow truck, you need to replace your radiator the moment it shows signs of giving way. But don't just go for the first replacement radiator you see at the auto store. You need to invest in something that'll last years without acting up in any way. You need a world-class replacement part like the Koyo Cooling Radiator.</p>Few manufacturers can match Koyo Cooling when it comes to making heavy-duty radiators. The company's radiators all meet or exceed OE and industry standards. They do not require any relocating, cutting or drilling, making them perfect for DIY mechanics. If you don't have sufficient DIY background though, it's still best to go to a professional mechanic for the installation of your new Koyo radiator. Once installed, you'll be amazed at how cool your car will run. Since the Koyo radiator is designed to maximize cooling capacity, you'll never have to worry about overheating for years.While a new radiator by Koyo Cooling will do wonders to your vehicle, it's also important that you choose a high-quality antifreeze or coolant for the best results. As you may know, antifreeze works by lowering the freezing point of water and raising its boiling point, protecting your engine from damage due to extreme temperatures. Find a premium coolant that maximizes this capacity and has excellent anti-corrosive properties to extend the life of metals in your new Koyo radiator and coolant passages in the engine. Finally, it's important that you do a thorough cooling system flush before installing the new radiator to ensure you won't have any corrosion or leak problem in the future.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

So if your vehicle refuses to start during cold mornings, then something must be wrong with the glow plug. A common cause of glow plug failure is a bad relay, so check yours if it's still in good shape or not. If it looks worn, corroded or burnt, throw it away and prepare to install a replacement part. And to make sure your replacement relay will last longer and perform better than the one you just lost, go for a Kracker Grow Plug Relay.</p>The number of manufacturers of car electronics today is simply astounding. The problem is, many of these manufacturers make flimsy replacement parts that'll just put your ride in jeopardy instead of restoring it. So to make sure you're not making the wrong choice for your next relay, choose Kracker, a well-established manufacturer of heavy-duty replacement auto parts. The Kracker Relay stands out among the rest 'cause it's made of extremely durable materials and it undergoes a variety of quality checks before being rolled out the factory. Ease of starting will be immediately noticeable once this premium relay is installed in your vehicle.The reason why many glow plug relays fail is that they're designed to keep operating even when the engine is hot. Pressure eventually ruins the relay 'til it cannot help ignite fuel anymore. In fact, the typical factory relay can literally burn and corrosion can eat away at its threads due to wear and tear. If you can easily remove the brass studs from your existing relay, then chances are, it's already about to fail. You must replace it as quickly as possible or risk getting stranded in your garage every morning 'cause your car just won't start.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

When a bearing goes bad, the results can be catastrophic-that is, severe engine damage that may even render the whole thing useless. To avoid paying up big time at the auto repair shop, install a KS Main Bearing Set as soon as you can. This set includes all the bearings you need to get your engine back in perfect shape.</p>KS stands for Kolbenschmidt Pierburg Group and it's one of the global leaders in the manufacturing of high-quality automotive parts. If you want a brand you can trust when it comes to auto parts, then you can't go wrong with this one. For instance, their KW Wrist Pin Bushing Set is absolutely the one you're looking for if you want your next wrist pin bushing to last much longer than what you currently have. As you know, the wrist pin bushing receives massive forces every time you drive. So massive, in fact, that some wrist pins literally melt under pressure. But with a Kolbeschmidt wrist pin bushing in your vehicle, you can relax knowing that your bushing will perform excellently for years.Another part of your car that could cause havoc when it fails is the thrust bearing. As you're probably aware of, aside from reducing friction, this particular bearing has the additional task of controlling your crankshaft's endplay movement. If you hear the bearing clattering or making any sort or noise, you must replace it right away or put other parts in serious danger of failing, as well. The KS Thrust Bearing Set contains every piece of hardware you need to put in a new, flawlessly performing thrust bearing.

If you've never replaced your thermostat before, you should replace it now or driving will be totally frustrating and freezing. Be careful with the replacement part you use though, 'cause there are many substandard thermostats out there. To get the best results, install a Kuzeh Thermostat-a high-quality replacement thermostat that countless drivers all over the country rely on.</p>You can't go wrong with Kuzeh because the company strictly observes all OE specs and industry standards in the manufacturing of their world-class thermostats. These thermostats are built from premium materials and are tested in extreme conditions to ensure impeccable quality. As you may know, thermostat problems, while relatively uncommon, almost always fall into two types: thermostats that stick shut and thermostats that stick open. A thermostat that sticks shut typically causes the \"Engine Temp\" light to turn on, and you might mistake it for coolant leak. If you don't see any leak and the light is still on, check your thermostat as it's probably stuck shut.Meanwhile, a thermostat that's stuck open is harder to diagnose because a lot of vehicles aren't equipped with a \"Low Engine Temp\" light. In fact, many drivers don't even worry about cool engine temperatures. But here's a very good reason why you have to replace a thermostat that's stuck open: it creates considerable mileage penalties of up to 7%. That's because the low temperatures will cause fuel to condense on the cylinders, hindering proper combustion.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

A regulator so durable that it'll last years without acting up in any way, and instead deliver the best performance you can imagine. You need a world-class replacement part like the Kyosan Fuel Pressure Regulator.</p>You've probably heard of Kyosan if you've been into DIY auto modifications for a long time.

After all, it wouldn't be such a good investment if the oil cooler you install stops functioning properly after just a few months or a year. You need something of world-class quality-something like the L&amp;R Oil Cooler.</p>L&amp;R is well-known to many serious DIY modders out there. The company manufactures various auto parts that comply with the highest industry standards. Their oil cooler is engineered from high-strength materials, so it can withstand extreme temperatures under the hood without wearing out quickly. It's also precision-machined to match many makes and models, so expect the fit to be nothing less than perfect. You'll have no trouble installing this aftermarket part provided you have enough DIY background. Once installed, your oil will cool much more efficiently and your engine, radiator and tranny will all be protected from the adverse effects of extreme temperatures.As you know, an engine needs transmission fluid and oil to cool down since it generates tremendous amounts of heat once combustion starts. Between 180 to 200 degrees, oil in the engine serves as a coolant, cleanser and lubricant for engine parts. Problems start to happen when, due to various factors, oil is prevented from dissipating its heat fast enough, causing the temperature to rise beyond the acceptable range. Result?

Even when they've had their clutch repaired or replaced, it still doesn't solve their problem. If you're one of them, listen up. It isn't your clutch which is causing the problem. It's most likely your bellhousing. It's that part of your car's drivetrain that covers your clutch and flywheel. If it's damaged, it may cause severe clutch problems such as a hard pedal, or worse, clutch damage. Unless you want to spend more on these parts, get the Lakewood Bellhousing. This isn't just for ordinary applications. It's designed for cars used in professional competitions - drag, stock, trucks and even tractors. You'll get this bellhousing in its raw form. The design lets you custom fit the bellhousing onto your vehicle, especially if yours has custom-built parts. You even have the option to choose whether or not to have a provision for the starter and what kind of linkage fits your clutch system. This is the real deal! The Lakewood Bellhousing is approved for use in competition by all major race sanctioning bodies. This is as professional as you're ever going to get. Whatever race circle you're in - drag, circuit or drifting - this is the bellhousing for you. It even has an optional inspection cover so you can easily adjust your clutch anytime during competition. When it comes to competition, you need equipment that's both versatile and durable. The Lakewood Bellhousing gives you both.Stop wrestling with your clutch pedal! A rock-hard pedal is the sure sign of a worn out or incorrect installation of the release bearing fork. The fork-as its name suggests-pokes at the clutch release bearing. This disengages the pressure plate from the flywheel whenever you step on the clutch. Once it's worn out, it may slip from the release bearing causing your pedal to freeze. You're only going to give your left leg an unnecessary workout. Replace a worn out fork with the Lakewood Release Bearing Fork. Some other signs of a worn out fork is grinding gears while shifting. That means even if you press on your clutch pedal, your transmission is still spinning in rhythm with your engine. Simply put, your clutch isn't letting go as it's supposed to. That's because the worn out fork can no longer push on the clutch release bearing. If you don't replace it immediately, it could even be more damaging to your clutch and you'll end up spending more. Replace it as soon as possible with the Lakewood Release Bearing Fork. It's made of heavy duty, stamped steel to give ultimate strength and high resistance to wear and tear. It'll last much, much longer than your old, beat up fork. Treated with a zinc dichromate finish, the fork becomes incredibly resistant against rust. No wonder it has been tested and approved even by all the major race sanctioning bodies. Get professional clutch performance with the Lakewood Release Bearing Fork.If your car's clutch pedal feels sluggish or is too hard to press, don't worry. It's not your knees that are causing the problem. You don't need to take vitamins or exercise at the gym to strengthen your knees. The problem is with your clutch's settings. Even if you've just replaced your clutch - disc, pressure plate, release bearing - it would still feel like awkward if it's not adjusted properly. The Lakewood Clutch Pivot will give you that kind of adjustability. Inside the bellhousing, the clutch fork acts like a crowbar which pushes the release bearing whenever you step on the clutch pedal. This fork rests on the clutch pivot - sort of like a seesaw. The problem is when you install a high performance clutch you may have to adjust the fork. Without an adjustable pivot, you won't be able to solve that problem. What you need is the Lakewood Clutch Pivot. It comes with an adjustable washer which locks the pivot in place. Simply set the pivot's height to adjust clutch play and then tighten the washer to lock it in place. It even comes with an adaptor thread which fits into larger sized pivot bores. Whatever your ride is, this will fit right in. Don't be left out. Having an adjustable clutch fork will give you more freedom to try out high performance clutch kits. You just have to upgrade a little. Order the Lakewood Clutch Pivot now and set your clutch right.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

There are many ways to do this. One is through the use of a UV dye that instantly shows you the location of the leak. But if you want to save money, you can make a solution of water and liquid dish detergent then spray it on your AC's O-ring and hose. Turn on the AC and see where the bubbles are coming from.

It may also badly bottom out or incur significant damage due to external forces. Clattering and clunking noises, as well as vibrations during acceleration are the most common symptoms of a bad axle. Be careful not to confuse a bad axle with other problems though, such as wheel misalignment. Once you're absolutely sure it's the axle that's the culprit, work on replacing the busted axle but only if you have enough DIY experience. If you're not sure you can pull it off, it's best to seek the help of a professional mechanic.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

It should be the opposite. For what is power without balance? In simpler terms, learning how to go fast by stepping on the gas pedal is great, but without the ability to brake without upsetting your car's balance, you're no better than any driver out there. Race car drivers may look like all they do is step on the gas. But if you look at their feet, you'll see that they have amazing control over the brake pedal. With the Lokar Performance Brake Pedal Pad, you'll learn that there's a lot more to braking than you thought. Most drivers drive like there's no tomorrow - they give the throttle everything they've got and then step on the brakes as heavy as they can. Some drivers even develop the habit of 'riding' their brakes, which means they rest their feet on the brake pedal for as long as possible. Both these habits cause brakes to wear out faster. Your car also gets thrown off balance with wrong brake footwork. The secret is to conserve momentum by braking little as possible. The Lokar Performance Brake Pedal Pad will give you a firm grip and incredible feel of your brakes. It'll help you master correct braking techniques more easily. Remember, the trick is to use the brakes as little as possible. This racing technique will teach you how to control your throttle and speed. Learn proper braking with the Lokar Performance Brake Pedal Pad.A lot of car owners complain of their engines idling funny. Just after starting their engines, it idles just right, but soon after driving even short distances, the tachometer needle refuses to drop back to normal idling. It seems as if the engine idles higher after being driven. A lot of reasons can explain this, but one of the most common causes is a worn out throttle cable. You may not be aware but throttle cables are prone to wearing out and losing shape. This is what causes your throttle to 'stick', but not with the Lokar Performance Throttle Cable. If you want your engine to idle at constant rpm (revolutions per minute), you've got to get rid of your old throttle cable. Almost too often, during a car's problematic history, mechanics would rev its engine from the hood. Instead of stepping on the gas pedal, they yank the throttle cable to rev the engine. This makes it easier for mechanics to check the engine while it's running, but it doesn't help the throttle cable in any way. In fact, it causes the cable to bend through time, causing your gas pedal to stick. The Lokar Performance Throttle Cable solves this problem with its heavy-duty stainless steel braided housing. This prevents the cable from being pulled to rev the engine. Instead, mechanics would have to pull on the throttle arm instead. No more sticking throttles. Ever. Get a steady idle and smooth acceleration always with the Lokar Performance Throttle Cable.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

The only difference is engine oil cannot burn waste particles. It only carries it. These particles can get caught in the small areas around your engine, causing malfunctions. That's why you need a more effective filter. This Magnafilter Oil Filter works like magic - powerful magnets draw in metallic barbs as small as three microns, while filter material blocks particles which are bigger. This ensures that engine oil-free of impurities-gets pumped back through the engine. The filter keeps your engine parts safe from the damaging effects of particle buildup. It also makes oil less viscous. Meaning it flows much easier, thus able to collect more dirt and metal filings along the way. Make sure your engine stays clean on the inside. Use the Magnafilter Oil Filter on your engine.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

And to make sure that your replacement filter lasts a very long time, choose something that countless motorists around the globe trust: the Mahle Fuel Filter.</p>Mahle is a leading manufacturer of heavy-duty auto parts in the global automotive industry.

So many drivers have been pulled over by cops for pulling off stunts such as driving with their feet. That's the advantage of an automatic transmission. All you need is one foot on the gas and brake plus your other foot on the steering wheel. The only problem is the fluid inside the transmission. Just like engine parts, transmission gears produce a lot of sharp metal filings. These filings can cause damage to the rest of the transmission if left to flow around. Use the MagneFine Transmission Filter. It automatically draws in metal filings found in transmission or power steering fluid. Although transmission housings have a piece of magnet attached to their inner wall, it's not enough to keep the fluid free from metal filings. It's also located in a spot where you can't reach easily. You have no way of cleaning it once filled with metal barbs. The solution is setting up an extra filter to do the job - the MagneFine Transmission Filter. Its dual filtration system acts as a guard against particles sized anywhere between 5mm and bigger. A powerful magnet pulls in metal and iron filings-anything smaller than 5mm, very much like a hungry sea predator waiting silently in the depths for its prey. This filter is as effective as a sea anemone sucking in tiny sea creatures into its hungry mouth.

As you know, the belt allows parts such as the alternator, air-conditioning system, power steering and water pump to work. If it snaps while you're driving, the engine itself could sustain huge damage that might even make it irreparable. For this reason, it's best to replace your existing belt before it completely gives way. Using an MBL Multi Rib Belt is a wise investment that will not only protect your vehicle from severe damage, but also improve your vehicle's operation.</p>So how do you know if your accessory drive belt is failing? The best way to know is through visual inspection. If you haven't changed the belt since you got your vehicle, then chances are, it would show unmistakable signs of wear and tear. For instance, look for glazed or shiny spots on each side of the belt. These usually indicate that the belt rubs on another object, such as a bolt or flange. Look for cracks, too, which are sure signs that the belt is suffering from advanced age. If you see chunks of the belt missing, that means you should hurry and replace the belt immediately 'cause it will snap any time. Good thing you can always replace it with a high-quality MBL Accessory Drive Belt.As a DIYer, you must also know that the balance shaft belt is critical to the proper operation of your vehicle. The belt turns the balance shaft, which reduces motor vibration. The belt is connected to the crank shaft, the balance shaft and a wheel that applies tension on the belt. If your factory belt is clearly damaged, replace it right away with an MBL Balance Shaft Belt. This belt, as well as the other belts mentioned above, are made of highly durable materials, so they will last a very long time.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

Other electrical features have also been acting up. These are classic signs of alternator failure, so check yours immediately before it completely shuts down. Of course, the car will likely still run even when the alternator is bad because it will use power directly off the battery. But if you want all your vehicle's features to operate normally, you have to replace your bad component with a new, high-quality MEA Alternator immediately.</p>As you're probably aware of, the alternator is part of your vehicle's charging system, which supplies current to many of its devices. The alternator is basically a generator that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. Most of your vehicle's electrical systems actually derive their power from the alternator, which generates alternating current. It's a mechanical device that is powered by the engine itself through the crankshaft. The current it produces is vital to the operation of devices such as the radio, air conditioning, cooling fan, defogger, windshield wipers and headlights. If you don't want to drive a vehicle without all these mechanisms operating correctly, install a new alternator by MEA.MEA alternators are well-known for their exceptional durability and performance. Their efficiency and output are high but they operate with minimal noise unlike other run-of-the-mill alternators that cause a ruckus every time you drive. Their electro-magnetic design is at par with your factory part or even higher. Due to their precise built and flawless performance, they can increase the cooling ability of your vehicle and improve its air flow path. They also last years without acting up because of their solid construction and excellent materials.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

Of course, you want your next valve to last a very long time, hopefully for the rest of your vehicle's service life, so you have to invest in a really durable replacement valve, like the Mecano Bundy Heater Valve.</p>A bad heater valve has plenty of symptoms. If you spot a leak, then chances are, the valve is busted and it's leaking coolant that's necessary to cool your car. Another common symptom is that the vents only blow warm air even when you set the controls to maximum cold. This can happen on either the driver or passenger-side vent or both. Operation may be intermittent or the vents may not even work at all, which indicates the valve has completely ceased to work. Not to worry though if you're experiencing these symptoms because installing a new heater valve by Mecano Bundy will get rid of them all instantly.There are many possible reasons why a heater valve would fail. As mentioned, water or coolant leakage is a fairly common cause. Coolant may leak onto the valve's electrical connections, resulting in an internal short circuit.

Make sure that your next set of seals will last a long time, hopefully for the rest of your vehicle's service life by using a high-quality Mexico Valve Stem Seal for replacement.</p>As you may know, the main function of valve stem seals is to control the amount of lubrication in the valve train and combustion chamber. These seals typically give way in older vehicles, resulting in the oil drenching the combustion chamber, pistons and other parts. Such a situation then typically causes incorrect combustion.

Delaying the replacement job could result in the catalytic converter getting damaged or debris from the bad seals clogging oil passages. Lack of oil will drastically reduce your power and gas mileage. There's also a possibility that the engine itself will get damaged due to the abnormal oil flow.

If your existing tank has badly deteriorated, it may be the culprit in your vehicle's skyrocketing temperatures. To fix the problem, replace the tank right away with a high-quality Meyle Expansion Tank.</p>If the tank's in good condition, look in other parts for coolant leak. Radiator hoses, which are typically made of rubber, are known to develop leaks because they swell, harden and crack with age.

Chances are, you'll have to replace your brake pads if you haven't replaced them for a long time. You can't delay the replacement job because driving with bad brake pads is absolutely dangerous. Good thing you can save some money by replacing the pads yourself, provided you have sufficient DIY experience. For the best results, use a high-quality Mintex Brake Pad Set instead of run-of-the-mill pads.</p>As you probably know, brake pads help to stop your vehicle by squeezing the drums or discs through extreme friction. Over time, the pads wear out and stopping becomes difficult. Most pads come with a wear indicator that squeals to signal when replacement is required. Some pads do not have such a feature however, so you have to look for other signs such as abnormal vibration when you're stepping on the brake pedal. Once you confirm that your pads are indeed the culprit for your vehicle's terrible braking, replace the pads right away with a set of heavy-duty brake pads from Mintex.The brake pad set from Mintex saves you a lot of hassle and time in your pad replacement job.

You should act quickly and replace this bad valve or it will make driving your vehicle a really terrible experience. But you have to make sure that your next valve will last years, so you won't have to replace it again for a long time. For the best results, install a high-quality Mikuni Idle Control Valve.</p>There are a couple of reasons why the idle air control valve might fail, but one of the most common is carbon buildup. Over time, carbon accumulates in the valve, causing it to stick and ruining the vehicle's idle. Your vehicle may suddenly idle when you're driving at high RPMs or it may stall when you're driving at low RPMs. In most cases, cleaning the valve won't work because the carbon buildup would be too much or it would make the valve unfit for further use. If you want a long-term solution, it's best to install a new, heavy-duty idle control valve by Mikuni that would bring the system back in tip-top shape.The idle control valve by Mikuni is vastly different from average valves because it's made of high-strength materials.

Then install a header pipe to your exhaust system. As you know, your factory exhaust system is designed to channel harmful exhaust gases away from the vehicle. Unfortunately, your current system isn't that efficient. A custom header will vastly improve the flow of gases in your exhaust system, so your vehicle can go faster and generate more power. But you can't install just any run-of-the-mill header. If you want the best results, go for a high-quality Miller Header Pipe.</p>A header pipe changes the exhaust system in such a way that back pressure is prevented and the cylinders don't have to work as much pushing exhaust gases away from the vehicle. The pipe virtually creates a smaller exhaust pipe for every cylinder and channels exhaust gases into a larger central collector. The header is especially designed to perfectly fit under the hood and deliver exhaust gases in a specific sequence according to the firing of the cylinders. The result is the elimination of inefficient back pressure and significant performance gains. If you want these advantages in your vehicle, you have to get yourself a new header pipe from Miller.Miller manufactures some of the best header pipes in the industry. If you're a modder who wants to turn your vehicle into a high-performing machine, you just can't skip on the tremendous advantages of a header pipe.

While there are aftermarket auto products that could enhance the visual aesthetics of your auto, no less than the Mile Marker grille guard can add a tough and aggressive touch to your vehicle within a few minutes of installation.  Mile Marker grille guards, or sometimes referred to as the brush guard are constructed from chromed or powder-coated steel tubes that are bolted on to the fascia or your vehicle for the purpose of giving your vehicle a tough road look.  Actually, every Mile Marker grille guard is created to add an extra layer of framing for protection of the front end of your vehicle.  The extra touch of tough road look is only a secondary purpose in the production of the Mile Marker grille guard.  If you value the vital, and not forgetting to mention the fact that they are very expensive, components located at the front of your vehicle and want them to be safeguarded against harsh damages with just a small impact you should get a Mile Marker grille guard for securing the radiator, bumper, battery and grille.

Whether you are an on-road driver or an off-road enthusiast, there is a Mile Marker grille guard for you.Mile Marker locking hub.  There goes the question of when is the right time to lock the hubs, when the hubs should be unlocked, and whether it is wise to leave the hubs locked for a long period of time.  As a car owner and a driver, you have to know what the Mile Marker locking hub is created for.  The Mile Marker locking hub is devised to connect or disconnect the two front wheels to and from the front axle shafts.  The Mile Marker locking hub is proven to be useful when there is no need for auto parts to be connected to others for the purpose of mechanical drag reduction to increase gas mileage.  The Mile Marker locking hub may contribute to gas mileage only minimally, but still, economy is economy.  And aside from that, you get another advantage with a Mile Marker locking hub which is to reduce the effects of wear and tear to the front axle components since they are disengaged when they are not needed.  The Mile Marker locking hub should be engaged when going for a two wheel drive and disengaged when you are going on a four wheel drive.  You may contest that connected or disconnected, the Mile Marker locking hub cannot possibly help protect the already heavy-duty front axle parts.  Why don't you try it out for yourself to see how amazing a Mile Marker locking hub can be?You probably neglect checking on the towing capacity of your vehicle.  You probably haven't even thought of attempting to increase the towing capabilities of your vehicle, what more take advantage of it.  However you would want to believe that you don't have to tow anything in the near future, no one really knows when you would be in desperate need of auto devices that could give a great relief when time comes you have to tow something.  An aftermarket hitch may come in handy when you need to tow trailers.  While the hitch is attached to the chassis for the purpose of towing, there is a Mile Marker winch which is a mechanical apparatus that could coil up a rope needed to firmly attach the object in tow to the vehicle.  The simple construction of the Mile Marker winch includes a spool which is attached to a crank.  The spool is more popularly known as the winch drum.  Complex designs for the Mile Marker winch include gear assemblies that rely on electric, pneumatic, hydraulic or internal combustion for power.  To keep the Mile Marker winch from uncoiling, it includes a solenoid brake that may or may not use a mechanical brake or ratchet.  Winches are primarily used in sea vessels when pulling anchor, but the Mile Marker winch is practical to use when you have to tow another vehicle or a trailer and keep it in a secure hold with your vehicle to prevent getting accidentally unattached to your vehicle.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

And when processed well, rubber can result in materials that are tough yet flexible, durable and efficient. And NDK, one of the leading players in the auto industry, is in the manufacture of high-quality rubber parts for different automotive components. It offers seals of high quality, designed for the toughest conditions. Seals in general are designed to tightly close any gap between two mating surfaces. They are built to provide a leak-free seal to keep water and air from seeping out.</p>The company uses advanced manufacturing technologies and modern engineering methods in the production of its parts. It manufactures a wide range of seals for performance components, as well as many other related assemblies. Some of the sealing materials that you can get from the brand are its NDK drive axle seal, NDK crankshaft seal, and NDK seal ring. These are designed to remain flexible and long-lasting despite their harsh working environment.Like all other components in your vehicle, however, these parts also wear out over time. Wear and tear is normal as the parts age, and you need to pay attention to the said components to monitor their condition regularly. Check out for cracks and other signs of failure such as drying out. Also, if you notice any leak, it's one of the most obvious indications that the parts have failed. But, aside from checking the seals, you must also check the main components to determine whether they are still in good shape or if they're also having problems. If you find that the seals are damaged, replace them with new NDK parts immediately.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

Bolt on a combination Neuspeed supercharger and intake manifold, then hang on!</p><p>The Neuspeed strut bar acts as a frame member tying together the upper sections of your strut towers, increasing rigidity and improving handling</p>What are your suspension goals? If reducing the gap between your tire and your fender is a top priority, there are Neuspeed springs to get you there. If turning the fastest time at Road Atlanta is a top priority, there are Neuspeed springs to get you there, too. The company that has revolutionized the tuner market has Neuspeed springs to accomplish most any goal you might have with your car, and you don't necessarily have to sacrifice comfort to get there. The trick is the progressive rate technology used on street car Neuspeed springs. In many cases, the ride is actually more comfortable than stock, but when you start diving into the corners, your Neuspeed springs move into their performance zone and firm up tremendously. The result is that your cornering is vastly improved with no sacrifice in highway ride quality. Or take your suspension further with coilover kits that incorporate Neuspeed springs. With threaded perch rods, you can actually maintain full control over the stiffness of your suspension. Mated with premium aftermarket shocks, Neuspeed springs can get you closer to a race car suspension on a budget than any other manufacturer. All this should come as no surpriseafter all, Neuspeed springs live underneath some of the most successful road race cars on the circuit today. Now they can live under your street car too when you choose Neuspeed springs for your suspension build-up.Volkswagen models with the 8-valve 2-liter four cylinder engine have great balance, handling, and driving dynamics, but they're a little shy on power and torque. You can change all that and go after the 1.8T/VR6 crowd by adding a Neuspeed supercharger to your Jetta, Golf, or New Beetle. The Neuspeed supercharger utilizes a highly efficient Roots-type blower like that found in late-model GM 3800 applications. The advantage of this type of blower in the Neuspeed supercharger is that it uses less horsepower to drive and has nearly instantaneous throttle response. Since it's a positive-displacement design, boost is available from idle on up. You'll have three car lengths on the 1.8T guys before they know what hit them! The Neuspeed supercharger design also incorporates the intake manifold directly into the blower housing preventing unreliable couplings from being necessary. That means the Neuspeed supercharger doesn't leak pressurized air and doesn't have fittings that can dry-rot and become detached. The Neuspeed supercharger had reliability as its number one design goal throughout the engineering process. Now you can benefit from the simplicity and build quality of the Neuspeed supercharger on your Volkswagen, and enjoy the additional 50-70 horsepower that it'll provide from your engine.Do you understand the need for a Neuspeed strut bar on your vehicle? If you take a look under the hood, it'll become pretty obvious. See those points above your wheelwells where the struts mount to the body? There's no metal between them, so when you're cornering hard, the metal in those areas is free to flex. With a Neuspeed strut bar installed, you tie those two strut mounting points together with a heavy-duty crossmember. The Neuspeed strut bar takes the load from body flex and transfers it into the other strut tower, preventing your car body from flexing out of shape. Your suspension geometry is maintained more accurately and the car handles better, all by adding a simple Neuspeed strut bar under the hood. Each Neuspeed strut bar is constructed of either heavy-wall tubing or billet aluminum for exceptional strength, with the end fittings welded firmly in place. The Neuspeed strut bar then receives a durable powder-coat finish or chrome plating, and is ready to install on your vehicle in just minutes. Much like a cold air intake is on the engine, a Neuspeed strut bar is one of those essential additions to any performance street vehicle. A rigid chassis is required for optimal handling, and adding a Neuspeed strut bar is the first step towards building a stable suspension platform.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

Aside from these parts, the company also offers seals for the transmission system, the thermostat, and many other parts in an automobile.And to ensure that these new gaskets from Nippon Reinz will work well, you need to take good care of them. Although gaskets and seals are bound to wear over time, many of the causes of gasket failure are actually man-made. One of the leading causes of failure and damage on the gasket is improper installation. If the alignment is incorrect, for instance, then it won't seal properly and it would still allow air or liquid to spill out.

The clutch disc is the component that is sandwiched between the pressure plate and flywheel. When the two parts get in contact with one another, with the disc in the middle, the engine and transmission are properly engaged and power transfer happens. Meanwhile, the brake disc serves as the surface into which the brake pads clamp to produce the friction that will bring your vehicle to a halt.Both discs are durable components, especially if you get these from Nippon clutch. But, they are still subject to wear and tear. And when they are exposed to unfavorable conditions, they can become damaged. The clutch disc wears out over time, and this is natural given the disc's function. Too much heat can cause problems after a while, weakening the said part. Meanwhile, the brake disc also suffers from the same problem. Warping can happen because of heat, and the part can also become damaged if you forget to replace the brake pads and if their friction material gets depleted.

One is the size of the bushing. The part should be of the right size so that it would fit the part into which it will be installed. Second is the composition. It should be crafted from high-quality materials so that it won't easily give in to damage. Ordinary rubber is susceptible to a lot of damaging elements like extreme temperature, and it can wear easily. Choose a bushing crafted from stronger materials, able to resist damage. You'll find a bushing like this from Nishino.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

Before you consider anything else, start with your braking system first. You can consider this system as the primary assembly concerned with your driving safety, and there are different components involved in keeping this assembly efficient. There's the rotor, the pad, the caliper, and many others. Of these, the pads are the most frequently replaced because they contain the materials that generate the friction used by the brakes to bring your vehicle to a complete stop. During every braking, the materials thin out until they're totally gone. Now if you're looking for friction materials that are efficient and longer lasting, Nisshinbo is the name of the game.</p>Established in 2009, this company manufactures brake parts with focus on friction materials. Its parts are used not only in automobiles but as well as in machine equipment. All of these are designed to be efficient, backed by the company's ISO 9001 and ISO/TS16949 certifications. Its parts are so efficient that they are even used in 30% of the cars built in Japan. And now, the company has ventured out of its original territory to serve car makers across the globe, including the big three manufacturers of the US. Now, doesn't this say a lot about Nisshinbo and its reliability?The pads from the brand are very efficient at producing the friction needed to stop your vehicle. Aside from performance, these pads are also built to promote environmental safety. How? Well, the company uses only materials that are environment-conscious in its production of each Nisshinbo brake pad set. In fact, it calls its brake pad line up as Green Pad, highlighting its concern for the environment. Other than pads, the company also produces other brake parts and assemblies. It even offers complete drum brakes and disc brakes, perfect for upgrading a failing braking system.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

Fuel efficiency, maximum horsepower, unparalleled speed, auto detailing, electric vehicles - is there still an area of improvement that automotive companies have yet to discover? Yes, maybe there's more. As long as there are still geniuses who tinker and play around with cars, there's a huge possibility that something might still be innovated one day. Back in 1978, a simple small town guy named Mike Wood tinkered around with his car using a nitrous kit. He experimented with the nitrous oxide element and found it could give his vehicle tremendous power. Soon after, Nitrous Express was born.</p>A few years after his discovery, Mike found himself swamped with requests to produce a reliable nitrous oxide system that won't backfire or pop in the combustion chamber. The process was difficult, and it had to undergo a few trial and errors, but Mike and his team worked hard. Today, the Nitrous Express nitrous system is widely used by most car owners who want an extra boost of power to their engine. Most race cars install the nitrous oxide injection system in their engine because it can greatly increase the horsepower of their rides. Nitrous oxide allows around 33% of oxygen saturation, and this allows your engine to burn even more fuel than it normally would.Although the injection of nitrous into the car's cylinders can skyrocket the horsepower of your vehicle, it also raises a lot of reliability concerns. With such an intense amount of power packed in your engine, wouldn't the engine fall and collapse under great stress? The system may have its downside, like cracked combustion components, including your crankshaft and pistons. But that won't happen if you use Nitrous Express because each NX component goes through rigorous evaluation and testing process first before being delivered to distributors.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

Yes, those parts are necessary, but a lot of car owners prefer cheap and generic seals, thus the market rate of branded sealants haven't reached maximum potential yet. Some people just don't want to bother with costly seals, preferring to bank their money on larger automotive components, or the 'big bosses' of the engine. But the 'small employees' or 'corporate slaves' of the engine must be taken care of as well. NOK is one of the companies who took the risk and plunged into the sealant section of the industry. And, fortunately, the risk paid off.</p>The company began in Japan as the first oil seal manufacturer. NOK products soon conquered the world and showed that people must also give due importance to the sealants in their engine. For over seventy years, the brand has exceeded the expectations of most car enthusiasts with their tough line of adhesives. One of the company's products is the NOK wheel seal. The wheel assembly is probably the most abused and used part of the car since it is in constant contact to the rough ground. As a result, the wheels are regularly subjected to friction. But with the brand's line of wheel seals, friction is minimized on the wheel hubs and grease is sealed in effectively.For the materials, the brand uses top quality rubber, like acrylic and silicone. The resistant rubber materials are effective, especially the NOK camshaft seal which thoroughly ensures no amount of oil leaks out of during camshaft rotation. Acrylic rubber is oil and heat resistant, like silicone. For a more powerful sealing effect, fluorocarbon rubber is also found in many of the sealants produced by the company. Fluorocarbon surpasses silicone when it comes to heat resistance, and because of the material's well-balanced properties, it is by far considered the most effective rubber for oil seals.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

The first thing to look into would be the main exhaust components. Other than these, however, one other thing that you should not ignore is the positive crankcase ventilation system. You can consider this as a part of the emissions assembly because of its function-it routes unburned gases and vapors back into the engine to prevent their release in the environment. The main component of the PCV system is the valve, and it's the part that determines the system's efficiency. With a valve from Novo, you can be sure your car emissions will be a step cleaner.</p>The PCV valve is a simple valve involved in the control of the amount of air and emissions directed from the crankcase back to the engine. Air is needed for flushing the unburned gases back to the combustion chamber for burning, but the flow of all the elements involved should be regulated to avoid problems. This is what the Novo PCV valve is designed to do: to regulate. And, Novo crafts all its valves to be efficient in performing their functions.You have to know, though, that these valves are replaceable components. Meaning, they don't last forever and will need to be replaced after a while. The most common replacement interval recommended for the valves is every 50,000 miles. You must also periodically watch out for clogging because this is usually the most common valve issue. In other instances, the parts might become stuck (open or close), and this can cause several problems. Depending on the problem, a damaged PCV valve can manifest itself with a decline in the performance of your vehicle. Should you suspect the valve to be damaged, don't hesitate to replace it with a new Novo valve.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

Aside from that, exposing yourself to a dusty room is also a health hazard. Just like your room, your car also needs to be maintained regularly. One way of keeping your car's tiptop condition is by installing filters in the engine. The brand NPN does a great job of cleansing and filtering the parts of your car with its line of reliable filters that are manufactured to OEM specifications.</p>Dust and other particles will also float around inside the cabin when you don't have an NPN ACC cabin filter installed. To thoroughly cleanse the air inside your cabin, the brand uses particulate paper and activated charcoal on its products. The combination of these materials guarantees a 98% removal of all particulate contamination circulating inside your cabin. Riding inside a car with no efficient cabin filter is like staying inside a dirty room. It can be hazardous to your health because the very air you'll breathe will be filled with dust and other harmful particles.The cabin filter not only reduces the presence of contaminants, but also increases the amount of airflow entering the interior of your car. The filter will improve the performance of your HVAC system, thus providing you with a cooler, more comfortable atmosphere inside your car. With the use of particulate paper, NPN can filter even the most solid pollutants, like brake friction particles, road dirt, and environmental pollens. Combined with activated charcoal, the cabin filter will also rid the air of diesel soot, vehicle emissions, and unpleasant roadside odors.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

But over a period of time, scratch marks will begin to destroy the once smooth surface of your laptop and phone. And when that happens, the gadgets will never look the same again. The acrylic plastic found in most of your car's accessories and parts may also accumulate scratch marks. But Novus can remedy these unsightly blotches with a few simple swipes of their premiere car care products.</p>Back in the 1970's, car owners don't usually use car care products on their vehicles. Waxes and stain removers aren't popular yet, but when Novus introduced their line of plastic polishes, people started to give more attention to the condition of their car's accessories. Maintenance products for the interior and exterior parts began selling like hotcakes, among them the Novus scratch remover. A bottle of this solution can help clear away the scratch marks on the acrylic surfaces of your car, just like how acne solutions make pimples disappear on a person's face.Plastic products weren't as widely used back then. Only when Novus pioneered the use of plastic polishes did the plastic industry boom significantly. Suddenly, people are keen on using cleaning agents and solutions for the plastic accessories in their cars. The interest on plastic care grew and today, the brand is regarded as the professional and expert choice when it comes to removing stains and scratch marks on plastic surfaces. The company produces two kinds of scratch removers-one for fine scratches, and another for heavy scratches. Haziness and abrasions can be eliminated with the use of the fine scratch remover, but when the marks are too severe, you may opt to use the heavy scratch remover instead, although this one's not recommended for coated plastics.

It sometimes gets too hot that you don't know what else to do except to turn on the wall fan, standing fan, ceiling fan, and air conditioner all at the same time. And when that's not enough, you even use a fan to cool yourself more. Imagine the heat constantly generated by your engine. The metal parts inside it definitely won't survive if it doesn't use several cooling devices at the same time, like the fan clutch and water pump. But to better beat the heat, you must equip your car with NPW cooling components.</p>Even if you use all the A/C systems and electric fans in the world, it's still no use if the brand's not reliable. Same goes for your car. The heat can only be dispersed much quicker when you install cooling devices from the most trusted brands, like NPW. So for cooler bursts inside the engine, an NPW fan clutch is highly recommended. This fan is placed alongside the radiator and has four or more blades that spin in constant motion when the engine is lacking air. Just like switches on a regular electric fan, the fan inside your engine needs to be properly turned off and on as well. Engaging and disengaging this device is the job of the fan clutch.

But do you know that rings can also seal something else other than wedded bliss? Your car has a series of rings fitted inside some parts of the engine in order to contain and seal oil inside the components. These rings are not like those worn on people's fingers. Automotive rings are slightly larger, depending on the part they intend to seal. Instead of silver bands with 24-karat gold on the sides, rings inside your engine are made from tough steel or rubber that can endure the highest temperature and pressure. Some rings even look like arm bangles, like piston rings. When the subject of pistons and rings come up, most car owners never fail to recognize the brand NPR, or Nippon Piston Ring Co. Ltd.</p>The company produces the most reliable set of rings for your piston assembly. Nippon Piston Ring is a Japanese auto parts manufacturer that has been in the business for over 30 years now and their piston rings are continuously being used globally in most engines. This Japanese brand broke the boundaries and the international market by being the leading manufacturer for piston rings, and the company even has a European subsidiary-NPR of Europe GmbH. Most car enthusiasts want the brand's set of piston rings because of its high quality, and that's why it's fortunate that most automotive distributors carry Nippon Piston Ring's product line. It doesn't matter if the rings were made in Japan. What matters is that the rest of the world will get their fill of the top caliber NPR piston set.What makes piston rings so important anyway? What's the fuss about? Well, without the split metal rings, oil and compressed gases from the combustion chamber will start to leak. This leakage won't produce a very nice effect to your engine in general because the efficiency of fuel combustion will be greatly reduced. The pistons also bring with them extreme force and pressure that without the piston rings, contents of the combustion chamber might get out and affect other metal parts of your car. That's why the piston rings provide a gas-tight seal around the pistons to prevent disastrous leakage.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

A lot of lives would probably be saved and the number of people with ailments would decrease. But a person can think and feel for himself, thus there's no need for a monitoring apparatus constantly attached to the body. Your car, on the other hand, is a machine powered by an assembly of devices and components; hence it needs a number of sensors installed within the engine. For this, you would need to rely on a leading sensor brand, NTC.</p>The company has been manufacturing sensors and switches for several years now with the aim of providing the best and most accurate information. Faulty readings or malfunctioning switches may hinder efficient engine performance. Look at the information cluster panel mounted on your dashboard. These gauges don't just blink warning lights or turn the indicator this way and that.

If it goes beyond or lower than the required, a lot of internal problems will crop up. It's like a person suffering from diabetes or high blood pressure. Health risks and issues will surface if the sugar or blood pressure level dips or shoots up. But the coolant temperature sensor can monitor the engine temperature for you and translate any changes to the powertrain control module, or the PCM.

Hence, the company even coined a new acronym for their label-New Worldwide Brand.So how would the wiper blades from this company protect your windshield? There's no difference between an NWB wiper blade and a generic one, right? That's downright wrong. Since the windshield is the 'face' of the car and is exposed to dirt, dust, tree saps, and bird droppings on a regular basis-read: every minute of everyday-then a wiper blade is necessary equipment to free the surface from all those grime.

One must strive to strike a healthy balance between the two in order to enjoy a more fulfilled life. Balance must also be observed when it comes to your engine as well. In the fuel combustion process, the air/fuel ratio must always be proportional. Any imbalance will produce undesirable effects to your car. To determine whether this ratio is kept equal, NTK developed a full line of oxygen sensors that will cater to every vehicle make and model.</p>Regarded as the 'go to' company when it comes to oxygen sensors, the brand has an established market base worldwide and has forged strong connections with different automotive distributors around the world, especially in the United States. Each NTK oxygen sensor will fit into the engine seamlessly, like a missing Lego part. Indeed, your car is missing a lot if you're not using the brand's sensors. You'll get two-in-one when using oxygen sensors-a stabilized fuel system and an improved ignition mechanism. NTK knows the importance of a balanced air/fuel ratio, so the company ensures each sensor they produce exceeds the standards previously set by other companies.The trailblazing process followed by the brand makes their products one step ahead of the competitors', especially since the oxygen sensors NTK supplies are fitted with OEM connectors and equipped with a sensing element developed using technical ceramics. With this technology, the sensors can determine rich and lean mixtures more effectively, preventing the possibility of increased fuel consumption. Since the catalytic converter is sandwiched between two oxygen sensors, the amount of oxygen circulating inside the exhaust system is well-monitored.

An OCAP ball joint also strengthens the power of your steering system and provides an additional steering link force that is connected with the rubber bushings.For the suspension system, the brand manufactures parts that are engineered using sheet-steel, cast iron, or aluminum to better hold the suspension to the vehicle's chassis. To secure and sustain the connection despite rough road conditions, an OCAP control arm bushing is placed on the control arm. Just like any other bushing, this one is cylindrical made with rubber and metal materials. Although this part lacks ample size to prove its importance, the whole suspension system of your vehicle won't be stabilized without its help since it holds the necessary bolts into place.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

From being labeled as a country which manufactures cheap products, Japan has risen to become a magnate when it comes to cars. Mazda, Honda, Nissan, Mitsubishi... all these world class brands represent Japan's highly advanced technology. The country boasts some of the best automotive parts manufacturers and suppliers as well, like NTN, or New Technology Network, one of the premiere makers of bearings that are being supplied daily to different continents.</p>Because of the products' high quality, the Asian brand crossed international borders and gained a reputable number of automotive retailers that are eager to carry NTN's bearings. A 'reputable number' is actually an understatement since almost all online auto parts shop in the United States are offering this brand's products. What sets NTN apart, you ask? It has been in existence since 1918, so that's basically more than ninety years of experience in creating auto parts. Engineering and developing bearings for almost a decade now, it's obviously an unshakeable fact that the company's products can be trusted and that means your car is in good hands when you install it with NTN's bearings.Just imagine holding the NTN wheel bearing in your hands and think-around 18,000 employees worked together in order to deliver this to you. That's why it's no wonder that the company has hit 452.7 billion yen in 2009-and the money just comes pouring in, especially since the brand doesn't only sell bearings, but other auto parts as well, like the NTN timing belt tensioner or constant velocity joints. When using bearings on your vehicle, make sure you are fully aware of the list of problems you might encounter. Bearings are actually just simple pieces in an engine and most of the time, it is used to minimize friction between metal parts, like the NTN release bearing which diminishes any kind of friction between the release fork and presser plate levers.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

No matter where you drive, it pays to be always ready for the hot weather to keep you comfortable and to keep your sanity intact. Prepare for the unexpected and equip your vehicle with a high-quality fan from OCP Fans.</p>The company offers a wide range of fans that are great for use not only in vehicles but as well as in applications like tractors, bulldozers, and even airplanes. These are heavy-duty fans built to withstand rigorous conditions, all while efficiently providing your car interior with the air that you need for cooling. The products of OCP Fans are distinguished from other fans not only by their excellent function but as well as their vibration-free operation and the absence of noise as they work-a real plus for those people who want total convenience as they drive. They also come in different colors like chrome, gray, and white, and they're capable of adding some accents to your vehicle. Plus, because most of them already come with the needed installation hardware and installation instructions, mounting them is very easy.Once your OCP Fans interior fan is installed, you can expect it to serve you for a long time as long as you maintain it in top shape. The first thing to remember in keeping the fan working well is to maintain its cleanliness. As you use it everyday, especially if you frequently drive offroads, the fan can accumulate dirt and dust. This would be evident on the blades. Cleaning is a simple process that can help your fan live longer. The motor of most fans will also need lubrication to prevent disruptions and to keep the blades spinning smoothly. Plus, be sure to pay attention to any indication of damage on the fan. Once you notice any, do a thorough inspection to identify the culprit. If the damage is irreversible, replace the fan with a new one.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},
{"link": "<div itemprop=\"articleBody\" data-elemname=\"article_body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>A lot of people would still smirk when you tell them you bought something that's 'made in Japan'. In 1969, Sony even experienced difficulty in marketing their products because it's a Japanese company. Hence, the 'made in Japan' label on Sony products then was stamped at the smallest possible size. True, Japan has the reputation of manufacturing products with poor quality, but not everything that's Japan-made is unreliable and not all companies produce substandard auto parts that are disposable after a few miles or years. A Japanese automotive company that can prove the 'made in Japan' perception wrong is NSK. The company was established in 1916 and completely revolutionized the 'Japan-made products' way of thinking worldwide.</p>The first auto parts the company manufactured were engine bearings, including the NSK release bearing, a product that most distributors carry on their online shelves today. After sealing their niche in the industry as the leading manufacturer for automotive bearings, the brand tried its hand in engineering other car parts using precision machining technology. Soon after, more products were developed, including the NSK timing belt tensioner. This one also became successful and the company became a leading supplier to an international network of distributors. With the brand's timing belt tensioner, you can be sure the belt will continuously drive your alternator, A/C compressor, water pump, and other components without loosening.Another timing belt component the company manufactures is the NSK timing belt idler. Machined from tough and resistant metal, the idler does a great job of maintaining the correct position of the timing belt. So if you notice derailment or looseness in the timing belt, replace all of your idlers immediately. Try the brand's idler set and you might just like the way the circular metals stabilize your timing belt. But even if NSK already carries a wider range of products today, their first creation was still considered the best. They're still known as the premiere bearing supplier to the market, not the timing belt assembly distributor. That's because an NSK bearing is made from cast iron and pressed steel. The part is also self-aligning with an oil-proof duplex rubber seal.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

Aside from risking monetary loss, there's also a huge chance you're purchasing a product that's not exactly made from quality materials. For the brand-conscious car owners out there, be glad there's OEM to quench your thirst for premium and high quality engine parts.</p>You must be thinking... is there a brand that can give me car parts that are superior in quality while maintaining an exact fit to the specification of my vehicle?

Some parts even exceed the excellent performance of the OE pieces in your engine, like the OEQ radiator hose. Overheating has always been a perennial problem if your cooling system doesn't have a complete set of superior quality parts. How can a cheap radiator hose cope with the high performance energy of its boss, the radiator? It's much like giving an incompetent executive assistant to the CEO of the company. With a radiator hose from OEQ, you can be sure coolant is delivered efficiently to all heated engine parts, thus giving much needed assistance to the radiator, which deals with the difficult task of maintaining your engine's temperature.The transmission system also needs to be cooled at regular intervals and the OEQ cooling hose makes this possible. Transmission fluid must constantly circulate around the transmission parts in order to keep the temperature at a specific operating level. Once the temperature goes beyond or falls below the required, the transmission parts will heat up quickly. And you very well know what heat can do to your car's metal parts, right? But the cooling hose from OEQ is here to the rescue. This line will help pump transmission fluid to the coils inside the radiator, hydrating the parts efficiently.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

Finally, there is a brand which can fit your vehicle's specification snuggly while giving you the same OE quality you need.</p>It's probably a universal automotive knowledge that OEM stands for original equipment manufacturer. This means that a company may retail replacement parts that are built by the original part's manufacturer, hence the fit and quality matches the original or stock engine part. Most car owners who know their engines like the back of their hands usually go for OEM parts because these components usually provide almost the same level of efficiency as the original ones. Aftermarket parts are also preferred because the line offers a wide range of modifications like car graphics. But OE Aftermarket wisely combines both OEM and aftermarket parts into just one brand. You'll get the additional zing of the aftermarket division, while getting the premium quality found in OEM parts.If you want to customize your combustion chamber so it gives more power to your ride, you can start by getting an OE Aftermarket fuel injector.

And the brand that will most likely dispel any 'Oh, no' bouts is-Ohno. Yes, you read that right. Who would ever name their company after such a negative interjection? But this brand breaks the norm and labels each of their products with this surprise statement which everyone utters whenever something bad suddenly happens. It's quite the opposite though. Each auto part the company manufactures wouldn't give you and your engine any reason to shout 'Oh, no'. In fact, it's actually the farthest thing you'll be saying once you experience the brand's precise engineering and superb quality.</p>Let's take a look at the Ohno clutch pedal pad as an example of the brand's excellent manufacturing. But first, what do you need the clutch pads for anyway? Isn't it enough that you have a tough, steel-made clutch pedal in your car? Why cover it with a pad and lose its aggressive, hard-hitting look? That's because the clutch will suffer from irreparable wear and tear without the pedal pads. Since this part is constantly engaged, whether during gear changes or ignition starts, you would need to robe the pedals with protective covers to add comfort to your feet and also to reduce the chance of wearing. Ohno manufactures these pads using dirt-resistant rubber. Some are made with tough plastic that won't easily break even when placed under extreme pressure. The meticulously designed pedal pad will also add to the visual appeal of the interior, albeit the flashy colors and sparkles. Pads coated in black rubber are usually enough to bring a more polished look to your car's clutch assembly.To prevent overheating, the brand also has some solutions for your car. You already know the cooling system and all of its components are vital in maintaining the normal temperature of your car, so why not install an Ohno radiator hose to increase its efficiency? This way, the metal parts of your car won't suddenly suffer from a heat stroke. Add to that an Ohno radiator drain plug and you can definitely enjoy an upgraded cooling system.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

It looks like a simple circular metal plate that fits all four points and corners of your car. As simple as it looks, this part is actually tough and aggressive, like the Greek hunter constellation. The plates enclose your wheel hubs in a protective shield that effectively fights off a number of harmful contaminants that are too many to even mention. Road dust, debris, snow, rain, puddle, mud, rocks-you name it, the brand's wheel seal will fight it.Orion knows these contaminants will lead to the gradual deterioration of your wheels and bearings, that's why the brand provides optimum dust protection and wear sleeve, while maintaining a lightweight feel to your car. Adding the wheel seals won't drag down your car or add weight to it. In fact, these metal plates even ensure lighter handling and longer service life as compared to those cars driving with bare wheel hubs. Not only will your car perform better, but you also get to enjoy more value for your money because your wheels won't wear and tear easily due to minimum friction rotation induced by the wheel seals.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

It doesn't even need aphrodisiac pills for maximum staying power, nor vitamins to perk it up. All it needs is a dose of Optima, the 'ultimate power source' of automobiles. Batteries from this brand can provide your vehicle with incredible power surges and a continuous supply of electricity to help bring life to all electrical components in your car. Power outages and interruptions will no longer give you headaches once you equip your vehicle with a battery box from this brand because it can give you longer staying power than most ordinary batteries.</p>There's no reason for you not to trust the company's products because even the US space program chose to entrust the Lunar Rover to Optima during the 1960's, a period when people were going crazy over spaceships and rockets and trips to the moon. The company's wound cell technology captured the attention of the space program and also the profit-smelling noses of other magnates. In 1972, Gates Rubber bought the Optima battery technology and invested dollars to make sure the batteries were developed according to automotive specifications. Soon after, the battery boxes were being used worldwide to power different kinds of vehicles, from race cars to 4x4's to electric vehicles. The current parent company of the brand, Johnson Controls, even built a new production facility in Monterrey, Mexico to manufacture more batteries and to keep up with the insistent market demand. The Colorado factory is doing just as well, engineering and manufacturing thousands of batteries daily to be shipped to different points around the globe.Optima manufactures three battery boxes under its product line. Each battery box comes with a different colored top to distinguish its specific use and application. The Red Top is highly resistant to vibrations and powers your vehicle in a span of a few seconds, ranging from 1 second up to 10 seconds. The Yellow Top is capable of deep cycling and cranking power, while the Blue Top has starting and dual purpose models. Each battery is powered by a patented SpiralCell technology, making it last up to twice longer than most batteries in the market, including traditional flat-plate ones.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},
{"link": "<div itemprop=\"articleBody\" data-elemname=\"article_body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Small but terrible-that statement is basically the best and most fit description for all the gaskets in your engine. These thin metal plates can be compared to Disney's Ratatouille, the tiny mouse with superb cooking skills. This rodent is kept hidden under a chef's hat most of the time, unnoticed by all the characters. But each recipe and dish the mouse comes up with makes a huge impact to the picky taste buds of the diners. A gasket is also often unnoticed, hidden, and sandwiched among other components, but it definitely makes a large impact to the performance of your car in general. The brand OPT capitalizes on this importance though and manufactures an entire line of premium gaskets made for every vehicle model.</p>A lot of car owners usually don't give much attention to the gaskets in their engine. There's just too many gaskets placed in between each possible gap or space that one simply wouldn't bother fussing over all of them at the same time. But like all car parts, gaskets require extra care and attention too. The combined heat and pressure coming from your engine sometimes takes a toll on the gaskets, and these metal plates eventually get damaged, no matter how seemingly tough and sturdy these components are.Usually, an OPT oil pan gasket can prevent oil leaks coming from the reservoir. You need to regularly check this one all the time because oil is too precious to be spilled and wasted. Besides, the metal parts of your car need oil running through them all the time, and with a damaged oil pan gasket, the components will definitely suffer from dreaded oil loss which can choke up your entire engine. Aside from that, an OPT water pump gasket will be a huge help to your car too. Too much heat can stall or even make your vehicle inoperable, that's why coolant must be constantly pumped to stabilize the temperature. But if the gasket sealing the water pump fails, then you're in for a major coolant loss. Like oil loss, inadequate levels of coolant can bring harm to your ride as well. Try a heat-resistant OPT thermostat gasket as well to seal your thermostat's housing.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

Imagine a car without fender flares, bumper guards, or even mini LED light bars. When stripped of automotive accessories, any vehicle has the tendency to look blah and bland. It's like a woman clad in the simplest outfit-a white shirt, jeans, and sneakers. Some will say less is more, but when it comes to cars, sometimes it's the exact opposite. With this in mind, Pacer set the standard in manufacturing automotive accessories which not only add a distinct look to anyone's ride, but also bring a whole avenue of functions that are necessary to increase the driving comfort of your car.</p>Established in 1966, the brand has only one vision in mind-to create a wide array of accessories that will boost the appearance of vehicles. During those days, not too many companies were focused in manufacturing accessories. It wasn't the 'in' thing yet in the automotive aftermarket. But Pacer determinedly pressed on in this division and designed entire product categories which were previously non-existent in the industry. The Pacer fender flares, for instance, will give any car a more handsome exterior while shielding the fenders and doors from splashes of mud, sprinkles of road debris, and attacks of gravel. Unlike other fender flares, the brand uses a unique material which won't crack or peel even during the most drastic temperature changes.Another thing you can add to your ride to give it a more customized look is the Pacer bumper guard. Front and rear bumpers are usually at the frontline during collisions and accidents. Any vehicle that would bump into yours would meet head-on with your bumper first before crushing the rest of your car's body. Because of this, bumpers are heavily prone to scrapes and major scratches. To avoid such circumstances, Pacer has heavy-duty bumper guards which you can easily trim to fit your bumper and you can also mount them with less hassle just by using a strong adhesive tape.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

Pagid brakes are found in the calipers of vehicles from Ferrari, Porsche, and Callaway as standard equipment, and the company's real emphasis is on performance. If you have a high-performance vehicle, particularly one of European descent, Pagid brakes are most likely available to fit your car. In addition to shorter stopping distances, Pagid brakes have noticeably reduced fade after multiple stops. But the big advantage to Pagid brakes is their cold friction capabilityin other words, the amount of brake feel you get even when the pads are cold. Many performance pads don't stop well until they're warm, but Pagid brakes are built for real-world driving conditions. That means you get short, firm stops in all conditions. Whether your car sees primarily commutes to the office, or you get to spend time on the track, Pagid brakes are a worthwhile upgrade to your factory system. With seven compounds to choose from, you're bound to find the Pagid brakes that do just what you want them to.The problem with most high-performance brake pads is that they work great when they're good and hot, but their cold friction properties are abysmaland most drivers don't get their brakes too hot during normal driving. That's where the Pagid brake pad has an advantage. The S-type Pagid brake pad has all the high-performance characteristics you'd expect from a street/track pad, including exceptionally low fade. However, the Pagid brake pad also maintains good rotor grip right from a cold start so you don't have those gulp moments before the brakes have warmed up. Aside from their friction properties, most Pagid brake pad applications come with a special anti-corrosion coating that protects the non-contact parts of the Pagid brake pad from being attacked by salt and moisture. Anti-squeal shims are even included in most Pagid brake pad sets so the low noise characteristics of OE pads can be maintained even with a high-performance Pagid brake pad installed. If you have a VW, Porsche, Audi, or BMW, check out our Pagid brake pad offerings. They've proven themselves on the road and the track, so a Pagid brake pad set may give you just the braking qualities you've been seeking.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

Several decades ago, a large part of the world has a biased perception against Asian-made products, branding the auto parts cheap and unreliable. Most Asian companies, specifically Japanese ones, don't usually flaunt their labels on their products for fear of discrimination. From 'Made in Japan', the biased perception became 'Made in China', which later on evolved to 'Made in Taiwan'. But fast forward several decades later, and Asian automotive companies, like Paraut, have finally gained the respect of everyone in the industry.</p>Through continuously manufacturing products which exceeds the market's expectations, the brand has risen to become one of the movers and shakers in the automotive field. Paraut is a proud Japanese company with a regional office in Singapore, one of the richest Asian countries. Known for its reliability, quality, and OE specifications, the brand features a diverse range of auto parts and replacements for most Japanese makes. But since it already has a large market base outside of Japan, the company is pushing the envelope in order to come up with parts for more vehicle makes.One product that showcases the brand's reliability is the Paraut EGR valve, or the exhaust gas recirculation valve. This part has been in existence since the 1960's, when the emissions law suddenly tightened its belt. It has the capacity to lessen the nitrogen oxide emissions coming from your engine while increasing fuel efficiency at the same time. The nitrogen oxide emissions may stream out of your car during combustion cycles, and this may form smog which can cover the atmosphere, causing air pollution. Paraut's EGR valves are specially engineered to minimize clogging and to reduce irregularities in the engine, like valve knock or rough idling. The part works by allowing a small portion of exhaust to circulate back into your car's combustion chamber.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

Without this particular component, a vehicle can turn into an expensive piece of scrap. This is also the reason why Radtech survived in the business for twenty years. Thanks to the high demand for its superior quality radiators.The radiator is an important part of the cooling system. It is designed to keep the engine from overheating by lowering down the temperature of the coolant that flows through the engine. The air that passes through the radiator aids in cooling down the hot coolant. There are two components comprising the radiator: overflow tanks and a core made of small flat tubes. Aging vehicles are usually prone to overheating but this doesn't mean that a brand new vehicle may not experience radiator trouble. Neglect of conducting a regular radiator checkup or maintenance can cause engine to overheat. That goes true even if what you have is a Radtech radiator.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

But are these components the same? The air conditioning system of a vehicle is comprised of different components that work together to cool down the warm cabin air in order to give you a comfortable driving experience. One of these components is the a/c condenser. This component is located under the hood and it is where the actual heat dissipation happens. The a/c compressor delivers the refrigerant (like the coolant) into the condenser as a hot, high-pressure gas. The a/c condenser then cools down the hot refrigerant and transforms it into a liquid. The cool refrigerant then goes back to the other parts in the system to absorb the heat inside the cabin.  The function of the a/c condenser in the a/c system is very similar to the function that the radiator performs for the engine.</p>The radiator is just one part of the cooling system that keeps a car from having an engine meltdown. It is in the radiator in which the coolant is cooled down before it is made to circulate back in the engine. Aside from function, the radiator and the a/c condenser are alike in appearance. However, the a/c condenser is smaller than the radiator.Also, in terms of location in the vehicle, the a/c condenser is usually installed in front of the radiator to take advantage of the air that flows through the grille. The additional air produce by the radiator fan or the engine fan also aids the a/c condenser in cooling the refrigerant. Unfortunately, extreme heat, pressure, and the debris that are sucked in by the a/c condenser and the radiator tends to damage after sometime that these components end up failing. Once this happens, replacement parts are required. However don't choose just any brand, go for the high quality Ready Rad a/c condenser and Ready Rad radiator.

Sankei products are renowned worldwide for their superior quality and affordable pricing.  It was in the year 1940 when the Sankei Company was founded and ever since the company has grown into the famous company that we all admire today.</p>A switch is an electrical device that can break electrical circuit by interrupting and diverting the flow of electricity from one conductor to another. It can also start the operation of a component or a device like the coolant temperature sensor or the radiator cap. Also, it is important to note that not all switches are manipulated manually such as the light switch. There are switches that may be operated by process variables such as temperature, pressure, flow, voltage, current, and force by acting as sensors in the process. Switches like these automatically control a system.Sankei switches vary in function depending on the component/s that they would have to operate.  For instance, Sankei Switches coolant temperature sensor functions as a variable resistance thermostat that adjusts its resistance depending on the changes in the engine temperature. The role that this plays in operation of the engine is very important especially in terms of preventing the engine from overheating. Speaking of engine overheating, the Sankei Switches radiator cap also aids in keeping the engine in tiptop condition. The switch in the radiator cap ensures that correct amount of pressure is maintained inside the radiator to enable the efficient distribution of the coolant throughout the engine.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

Oh, and there's also a Skunk2 cam designed for you forced induction fans, so if you've got a turbo or a blower on your Honda or Acura, you can get even more power by installing the special turbo Skunk2 cam. So, back to our original question: How far do you want to go? Sure, a Skunk2 cam installation requires a lot more work than a cat-back exhaust or cold air intake. But if you've gone as far as you can go with simple bolt-ons and you still crave more, a Skunk2 cam setup will take you the rest of the way down the track.If handling is your thing, then moving to a coilover suspension system has probably crossed your mind before. Skunk2 coilovers offer an easy and cost effective method of gaining the coilover advantage on your import or sport compact vehicle. But let's back up: For those of you who don't know, Skunk2 coilovers replace your stock strut suspension setup with a more precise unit comprised of a shock absorber inside of a coil springhence the name coilover. Skunk2 coilovers maintain a precise ride track much more effectively than the stock strut suspension system, resulting in better handling, cornering, and even ride quality, without compromising tire life or safety. An added bonus is that Skunk2 coilovers aren't all that difficult to install, either. You need to have the proper spring compressors, but once you understand the system, you'll find that your Skunk2 coilovers are remarkably well engineered from both a handling perspective and an installation perspective. And Skunk2 coilovers are available for a wide variety of import and sport compact vehicles, from luxury vehicles like the Acura TL to factory race cars like the Subaru WRX. Remember, your car is only as good as its handling will let it be, so give that stock strut suspension the heave-ho. Skunk2 coilovers can transform the suspension performance of your vehicle.Nothing is better for your exhaust system than stainless steel, which is why every Skunk2 exhaust system is constructed of nothing but stainless. There's no option for mild steel or aluminized tubing because it's not the best, and the Skunk2 exhaust system is designed to be the best. As a cat back design, the Skunk2 exhaust system bolts on directly behind the catalytic converter on your vehicle. This type of setup has the huge advantage of being fully emissions-legal, so you don't have to worry about inspections or testing problems in your region. A cat back Skunk2 exhaust system is by far the easiest and longest lasting way to get wide open exhaust gas flow without tampering with your vehicle's pollution controls. Mandrel bent tubing is used throughout the Skunk2 exhaust system because by mandrel bending the pipe, the proper diameter is maintained throughout the curve. Other manufacturers use standard bending equipment that can reduce the pipe diameter by as much as 30% in a bend. Finally, the Skunk2 exhaust system is terminated into a high-flow stainless muffler that looks as good as it sounds. The low restriction Mega Power muffler used on every Skunk2 exhaust system has a huge 102mm polished tip and comes with the Skunk2 exhaust system badge etched into the metal. You can even get the entire Skunk2 exhaust system in a polished version if you enjoy the show as much as the go. Check to see if there's a Skunk2 exhaust system for your application: Most popular imports are covered, as well as a handful of domestic sport compact vehicles.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

{"link": "<div itemprop=\"articleBody\" data-elemname=\"article_body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>You can tell from the name Street Performance how its automotive products can increase vehicle performance on the streets.</p><p>Want to know the secret of the vehicle of your closest neighbor?  Experience a Street Performance auto part.</p><p>Every Street Performance automotive component is designed for excellence and perfection, a promise you can count on.</p><p>Bring the best out of your auto with Street Performance automotive parts that are tested for efficiency and dependability.</p>Generally, there are three types of car owners.  There are car owners that are already contended with the performance of their vehicles.  Others want to squeeze more out of the internal combustion engine and dedicate most of their time taking to car experts and enthusiasts to dig in the latest technology that could make the engine perform better.  On the other hand, there are car owners who prefer spending some time thinking of the best and unique ways to perk up the bearing of their vehicles.  Perking up the appearance of a vehicle does not necessarily imply adding auto accessories mounted at the exterior of the vehicle.  In more ways than one, you can transform the look of the engine with engine accessories that are primarily designed for enhancing engine performance.  When it comes to attempting a whole new look for an internal combustion engine, nothing beats a Street Performance coil cover.  Because of the ugly look the engine motors along with the ignition coils above the valve covers, the Street Performance has devised a way on how to better the current appearance of the engine with a coil cover.  Street Performance coil covers available in the auto market today are made from machined high grade billet aluminum and coated with fabulous finishing.  It might spark your interest in having a Street Performance coil cover for your own to learn that it is relatively very easy to install.  Now is the best time to have a Street Performance coil cover.If you are already amazed of the performance of your vehicle in terms of horsepower, speed, acceleration and torque, what more can you feel if you have a Street Performance throttle body spacer that could spell a whole lot of difference with the current vehicle that you have.  As a performance auto part, the Street Performance throttle body spacer eliminates leakage of air which robs some horsepower from your engine.  The Street Performance throttle body spacer is built based on the concept of attaining the ideal air flow to support the engine combustion processes for the purpose of enhancing the amount of horsepower available for powering your ride.  The Street Performance throttle body spacer is able to produce unrestricted air flow in and out of the engine, the result of which becomes very evident in the horsepower generated by the engine.  The secret of the Street Performance throttle body spacer lies in the ideal fuel and air mixture burning process inside the engine chamber.  When fuel is efficiently burnt, the level of airflow is increased which is noted by the onboard computer.  It is then the engine management system takes the corrective measures on the ratio of fuel and air being fed into the engine.  Apart from enhancing the efficiency of the combustion processes for an optimum engine performance, the Street Performance throttle body spacer also aims to prolong the service life of essential vehicle components including the emission control system which houses the catalytic converter and the oxygen sensor.One of the most affordable ways to increase engine performance is providing it with a Street Performance cold air intake.  In much the same way that you can appreciate cool air blowing towards you after soaking in the sun, the engine system needs cool air to take a breather after long hours of internal combustion work.  You can only guess how hot it can become in the engine compartment as a result of the fuel and air mixture internal burning processes and how it can be easily absorbed by the metal engine components which is not at all helpful in the kind of work the engine does just to power your ride.  Lurking under the hood is a component that robs some of the horsepower which should be intended only for powering your ride.  The airbox and the air filter is restricting the flow of air which could prevent cool air from entering the engine and failing to let the warm or hot air out of the engine.  The Street Performance cold air intake is ideally constructed of smoothened interior of intake passages and less restrictive air filter to supply cooler, denser air to the engine to be mixed with fuel available for internal combustion.  The cooler and denser the air delivered to the engine, the greater the horsepower it can produce.  A plus factor that could make you want the Street Performance cold air intake more is the fact that it could enhance the aesthetics of the engine bay.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

The level of detail that goes into each Tanabe exhaust system is nothing short of extraordinary, with premium materials, design, and weight reduction strategies employed throughout. Like what? Well, for starters, the Tanabe exhaust system is produced from mandrel bent 304 stainless steel, marking one of the first uses for this material in exhaust components. The high strength of this stainless material allows the Tanabe exhaust system to use thinner pipe, not for cost savings but for weight savings. Simply put, a Tanabe exhaust system can be thinner than the competition yet last longer thanks to better metals. Then, each Tanabe exhaust system is fitted with a premium high-flow muffler to reduce noise without restricting exhaust flow. Once the basics are covered, the Tanabe exhaust system then is subjected to a diet. Pressed exhaust flanges are used throughout the Tanabe exhaust system to keep weight down, and hollow hangers are also employed for the same reason. Details like this are what make a Tanabe exhaust system something different in a crowded market. If you're serious about your performance and only the best will do, you don't need to look any further than a Tanabe exhaust system for your exhaust needs.As part of the family of Tanabe exhaust products, Tanabe mufflers sit at the top of a crowded marketplace. Several innovations help Tanabe mufflers stand out, however, and make them the ideal choice for your sport compact custom exhaust build. For example, Tanabe mufflers are constructed entirely of the highest quality SUS304 stainless steel, fully welded in street trim for maximum durability. In race medallion trim, Tanabe mufflers are actually riveted together, but not for cost savings. This construction technique allows Tanabe mufflers to be disassembled and rebuilt in the event the internal material becomes packed or worn. Unlike other manufacturer's claims of a lifetime warranty, the rebuildable nature of Tanabe mufflers makes them true lifetime exhaust components. The special internal packing material used on all Tanabe mufflers, Advantex, allows less packing to be used to achieve equivalent sound reduction than with other materials. Less packing means less weight and less restriction, with more power being the result using Tanabe mufflers. Finally, just to assure the rest of the world of their quality control, the factory that produces Tanabe mufflers has achieved ISO9001 certification. It's just one more way of showing that you can trust the performance and quality of Tanabe mufflers on your import, domestic, or sport compact vehicle.Why choose a Tanabe Super Racing Medallion exhaust system for your sport compact vehicle? Well, if you're looking for an inexpensive way to make your car sound good without really producing additional power, you shouldn't. Poseurs need not apply: That's not what the Tanabe Super Racing Medallion is all about. Originally developed for motorsports applications, the Tanabe Super Racing Medallion has been adapted for street legal use while still retaining almost all its high performance breeding. For starters, SUS304 stainless steel is used throughout each Tanabe Super Racing Medallion system. Not only does this high-strength metal offer superior corrosion resistance, but it also allows the tubing used in the Tanabe Super Racing Medallion system to be thinner, reducing weight. Of course, mandrel bends are used anywhere the tubing has to curve to promote improved gas flow. As an example of its racing heritage, the muffler used in the Tanabe Super Racing Medallion system is a high flow design with a riveted case. The case design allows the Tanabe Super Racing Medallion muffler to be disassembled and rebuilt when the packing material wears out. This feature makes the Tanabe Super Racing Medallion muffler the only true lifetime muffler on the marketother companies can offer a warranty, but only the Tanabe Super Racing Medallion muffler can be overhauled to restore your exhaust system to like-new performance. It's just one more example of why the Tanabe Super Racing Medallion exhaust system is only for those who are serious about high performance.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

Some of the biggest and greatest companies we know today were born out of fragments of simple dreams and imagination, such as Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook. With hard work and perseverance, a simple ambition may indeed turn into a reality-a big, money-making reality at that. A lot of automotive companies also started out small before reaching global success. Fifty years ago, Willie Garner, founder and owner of TransDapt Performance, started his company in a small garage at the back of his house. This might be laughable, considering how big the brand has grown in the years following its birth.</p>It might be hard to imagine, but the first auto parts Garner manufactured, transmission adapters, were actually created and sold just within the confines of a garage. But he pursued his ambition, combining good quality with fair pricing, and soon after, he became well known in manufacturing a wide variety of auto parts, like the TransDapt differential cover, fuel injectors, and carburetor. After four years of struggling to make car parts within a garage, TransDapt transferred into a 40,000 square foot office, complete with a manufacturing area and warehouse space. Definitely not bad for small town, small time garage business.But in order to supply more quality parts to its network of distributors, the company expanded its operations even more, and now resides in a 100,000 square foot facility housing the latest in CAD design and CNC machining. This is the reason the TransDapt crankshaft pulley has been steadily gaining loyal patronage around the globe, particularly because it serves three purposes-to minimize crankshaft resonance, to act as the harmonic balancer, and to drive the serpentine belt around a number of components. TransDapt makes sure the pulley does all three functions well by engineering it using cutting-edge technology.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

It is because motorcycles and lawnmowers work in harsher conditions compared to that of a car. These use foam filters because foam traps more dirt than the use paper filter without compromising better airflow. This is the reason that inspired True Flow designers to make a foam filter line of air filters.</p><p></p>True Flow's line of air filters are foam filters that are made of reticulated foam that makes use of millions of tiny air cells in the foam, together with an emulsion product, to prevent dirt from getting into your intake system. This speaks of more mileage and a more efficient engine because it works on cleaner air. Unlike cotton and gauze filters, foam allows more air to go into your system. True Flow Air Filter's thick foam and larger surface area can suck up more dirt without clogging up dirt. Another advantage of having a True Flow Air Filter is that you don't have to throw them away when they're already dirty. All you need to do is give them a little rinse and they're good as new.<p></p>Aside from air filters, True Flow also has its own line of innovative cold air intakes that are a notch above the rest. The True Flow Cold Air Intake is different from other intakes because its cold air intake is located within the factory airbox of your car, not outside of it like other intakes. True Flow's Cold Air Intake is placed inside the airbox, isolating it from all the dirt, moisture and heat in your engine compartment. Because of its isolation, True Flow Cold Air Intake ingests more cold air that causes the engine to have a denser intake charge giving it more power.<p></p>So if you want to try something different, something far better than what you have been using, opt for the out of the ordinary like True Flow Foam Air Filters and True Flow Sheltered Cold Air Intake.

{"link": "<div itemprop=\"articleBody\" data-elemname=\"article_body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>There's a memorable quote from the movie 500 Days of Summer: \"So, what if I'd gone to the movies? What if I had gone somewhere else for lunch? What if I'd gotten there 10 minutes later? It was...it was meant to be.\" Yes, it's all about timing-or the right timing, that is. In life, love, and, yes, even in your car. It's actually far from being romantic, but even your engine needs proper timing and the right moment to get its act together, just like how a suitor bids his time when courting a girl he likes. A brand that guarantees the correct timing for your engine is TSU, the trusted manufacturer of anything related to timing assemblies.</p>Almost all mechanisms in your car need to be operated at the right time for maximum efficiency. That's why misfires and idle starts can be pretty annoying to most vehicle owners. Each stroke of the cylinder must be accurate, like the ticking of a clock, or else the engine won't be able to achieve the most optimum fuel combustion. But aside from the cylinders, another assembly also needs to be driven and operated at the right time to guarantee utmost performance. The timing assembly, as its name implies, must turn and function with painstaking precision or else your car would be inoperable. You can get this precise and accurate operation with a TSU timing chain, a reliable metal chain that doesn't miss or skip a beat when turning.Derailment is one of the common problems of timing chains. Either that or the chain misses or skips a tooth. Both can be dangerous because several components will stop functioning at the same time, including the water and oil pump, to name a few. But more importantly, when the chain becomes loose, the connection between the camshaft and the crankshaft will also be disrupted, and this will throw the rhythm of the valves off balance. With a derailed chain, the valves won't open and close at the right time anymore, and this could affect every stroke of the pistons. Prevent derailment with a TSU timing guide rail. In order to keep the chain tightened, a TSU timing chain tensioner is often placed in most cars.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

A successful union requires teamwork on both parties involved. The same can be said to all the different mechanisms and components comprising your car. These devices need teamwork and effort in order to propel your car forward. More importantly, switches, regulators, and cables must always work in harmony with specific mechanisms to ensure proper operation. But first and foremost, you have to ensure these components are made of quality materials to deliver the best results. No other brand can give you efficient regulators and cables than TSK, a leading manufacturer of auto parts to primary distributors worldwide.</p>So how important are these regulators, switches, and cables are? You're probably wondering-can't I just purchase these devices from generic and unknown brands? Well, basically, you can't, unless you don't want some mechanisms in your car to work. Regulators and cables are the roots of some mechanical operations in your car, like the windows, parking brake, and automatic transmission selector. If you want to keep your car's windows shut closed forever, then go ahead and disregard the need for a good TSK window regulator. It doesn't matter whether your vehicle's using manual or power windows. Without an efficient regulator to operate the windows, you won't be able to lower or raise the window glasses properly. And this failure could lead to safety risks and some riding comfort issues.Another product from the brand that will make your car work more efficiently is the TSK parking brake cable. This one's pretty important because it makes sure the hand-operated parking lever in between the passenger and driver seat will work properly when it's time for you to put the vehicle in park mode. TSK prevents the car from budging when the lever is hitched up and while the vehicle is parked, greatly securing your safety. Be sure to trace the cable frequently to prevent irreparable cuts or twists on the wires for consistent parking brake operation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

The Turbonetics Turbo Systems include everything that is needed for a car owner to install a bolt-on turbo that will deliver the performance you need when you want it. The complete system ranges from fuel and ignition all the way to the piping and all the fittings. This is the complete turbo system, encompassing everything from air entry all the way through the exhaust into the catalyst.

And all planning on the part of Turbonetics saves you any worry about an inexperienced tuner using your car for experiments.What good is a turbocharger if it doesn't have durability? That is the question that inspired the brains behind Turbonetics Turbochargers to seek an alternative bearing design. The Turbonetics patented Ceramic Ball-Bearing idea is the answer. Because the ceramic balls are nearly indestructible, the set-up removes concerns about the durability of a high-performance turbocharger.

Among the wide range of Turbonetics Turbochargers: The T3 Performance Series Turbocharger is the ideal choice for engines from 150 to 324 horsepower; T3/T4 Hybrid Turbochargers bring together the best of both types, with fast response and high-airflow capacity; The T04B and T04E series provide the most versatility for those who are seeking aftermarket turbochargers at competitive prices; If you need proven performance across the range of racing, the 60-1 Performance Turbocharger is for you.

It's a different kind of high when you're at the top of your game that it can be pretty hard to stop yourself from hitting a dead end. But you have to be careful when you put your life on fast forward because you never know when you'll smack into a sudden roadblock, or a life obstacle. Sometimes, you also need friends to remind you or even force you to slow down and take a break. When it comes to slowing your car down though, you've got a great buddy who's always willing to help-UBD precision brake engineering parts.</p>Some drivers have the tendency to move extremely fast when the road's clear of traffic. Hard-headed ones even disregard traffic signals and stoplights. It's the same kind of high you get when you're on life's fast lane. But putting your wheels on fast forward all the time can jeopardize your safety and others' as well. It's fortunate though if you have an efficient brake system to serve as a reminder that you should stop your car when it's already going too fast. UBD is a brand most drivers rely on because of its responsive and precise brake components. Just like how a friend stops you from hitting a roadblock, this brand also puts to a stop any crazy speed games you're playing on the highway.To increase the efficiency of your brake system, a UBD brake caliper must be placed on the brake rotors. It's a U-shaped metal hydraulic clamp which is attached to the rotors firmly in order to create the friction that is needed when stopping your car's wheels. Once your foot hits the brake pedal, high-pressure fluid is automatically routed from the master cylinder all the way to your car's brake calipers. The metal clamp presses against the brake pads and creates friction, which in turn stops the spinning of the brake rotors. Your wheels are then stopped, just in time for that glaring red stoplight.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

{"link": "<div itemprop=\"articleBody\" data-elemname=\"article_body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>We don't often look at them twice but they're there. We might not hear them speak, nor talk as they silently go about their duties, but without them, a corporation won't be complete. They're the maintenance staff-the janitors of the company. Their work and wages may seem insignificant compared to the VPs and managers, but without them, the entire floor won't be as put together. The gaskets of an engine are in the same position-unnoticed and seemingly insignificant, but these pieces play a large role in keeping an entire mechanism together. One brand goes the extra mile though in making sure these 'small workers' are a cut above the rest-Uchiyama Manufacturing Corporation, makers of automotive sealants and gaskets.</p>Started more than a century ago in 1898, the company initially produced cork stoppers using synthetic rubber, but the brand eventually ventured into making sealants and gaskets for automotive applications. It wasn't a far cry from cork stoppers, but this new division gained the company more business partners and a larger market share, probably because sealing agents for vehicles weren't widely manufactured during those days. Uchiyama gaskets and sealants became hugely successful, and today, the company continuously produces bearing seals, hybrid gaskets, and both soft and hard gaskets. The brand also boasts of a large manufacturing plant in Okayama, as well as other offices in major Japanese cities, including Osaka, Hiroshima, Tokyo, and Nagoya. The company is not only popular in Japan, but its products are currently being distributed worldwide as well.Perhaps one of the most important gaskets the company produces is the Uchiyama valve cover gasket. Valve covers, also called as rocker covers, are firmly secured over rocker arms to provide a protective shield on the intake and exhaust valves. These valves play an important factor in the fuel combustion process hence a protective covering is necessary. The rocker arms also need constant lubrication so it could operate efficiently. Valve cover gaskets from Uchiyama are effective in containing the oil within the engine to avoid unwanted seepage. Aside from that, the brand's gaskets also keep contaminants out so the oil retains its pure and fresh quality.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

Arrows are just simple sticks with pointed edges, but these lines serve as guides which lead people to the correct destination.

That's not all. The company also invented the now famous stainless steel gauge face and has patented the successful innovation as well. The brand also created even more dramatic designs for the gauge faces and introduced the Aqua Edition and Aqua Mariner line to the market several years back.The colorful gauge faces you see on your car's dashboard do not only give you the correct information, but these round meters also bring a touch of style to an otherwise plain-looking instrument panel.

For maximum visibility, you must ensure the taillights, headlights, and even the parking lights are all blasting wide beams so your vehicle can be seen clearly even if you're still a few miles away. To get strong bursts of light, mount VAIP - Vision Lighting parts to your car and you can avoid tons of potential accidents on the road.</p>Parking lights are just second priority next to the headlights and rear lights. These lights were previously used when a vehicle is parked in a dimly lit area. But today, parking lights are mostly used to reinforce the signal beams blasted by the head and tail lights. During daytime driving, most drivers just use their parking lights to reduce 'light' pollution. These are usually mounted right beside the headlights, on the sides of the car to further boost the head or rear lights' beams. If your head or rear lights emit feeble glows, you can greatly enhance the visibility of your vehicle with a VAIP - Vision Lighting parking light. The lights from this brand are strong enough to penetrate through even the heaviest sheet of darkness and mist, reducing the risk of accidents even if you're passing a street with no lamps.Another safety lighting assembly you must mount on your vehicle is the VAIP - Vision Lighting turn signal light. These lights emit bright illumination to alert other drivers if you're changing lanes or turning another direction. And if you want more visibility while adding style to your ride, you can also fit side marker lights complete with a VAIP - Vision Lighting side marker lens near the fenders so other drivers will be able to clearly see the side profile of your vehicle. It's a great way to add a finishing touch to your ride while boosting your nighttime protection as well.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

More specifically known as the tow hitch, the Valley hitch is also referred to as the tow bar or the recovery point.  All of these terms refer to one and the same thing, that device attached to a vehicle's chassis when towing.  Valley hitches can take on many forms.  One type of a Valley hitch is designed as a tow ball to permit spinning of the trailer.  Another design for a Valley hitch takes on the form of a tow pin and jaw coupled with a trailer loop that is ideal to use for agricultural applications.  The loose property of the pivot pin in a tow pin and jaw type of Valley hitch allows similar motions.  A rare type of hitch is the towing pintle which is used in military automobiles.  The Valley hitch is a mechanism that attaches to the chassis of the vehicle to be linked to a trailer or another vehicle in tow.  Valley hitches available in the auto market today come of various designs; each and every one of them is crafted for precise fit in major car makes and models.  With a Valley hitch, you can have a very functional auto accessory that comes in a very reasonable price but guaranteed of high quality and performance.  Effortlessly, you can install a Valley hitch in your vehicle.  Grab a Valley hitch now!Since the introduction of the Under Bed System conceptualized and popularized by Valley to the car owning public, many has discovered a space saving technique that come in a single automotive accessory.  Not only this, Valley's Under Bed System can perform three functions in just the price of one.  All you have to purchase is a single Valley hitch mount, but with that, you are actually having three hitch mounts in one construction.  The Valley gooseneck hitch, Valley fifth wheel glider and the Valley fifth wheel glider comes in a single Valley hitch mount.  The Valley hitch mount is attached to the cross members located underneath the truck bed.  The hitch that is used for towing is directly attached to the four mounts without touching the truck bed.  In case you have no need for the hitch just yet, you can remove it easily from the Valley hitch mount to take advantage of the truck bed.  With a Valley hitch mount, you are guaranteed to have at least five years of use without any signs of malfunction or faulty devices within that time span.  Virtually all Valley hitch mounts out in the market today are made from black polyester powder coating to guarantee high resistance against rust and corrosion, making the Valley hitch mount one of the long-lasting towing accessories to own.  Just think of how much a Valley hitch mount can give you at such a very affordable price.  A Valley hitch is definitely worth every penny you spent.It is mandated in certain state laws that trailers, when towed by a vehicle, should have running lights, turn signal lights and braking lights as a safety measure.  Because the view of the driver of the car behind the trailer could not see the turn signal lights, running lights and braking lights installed in your vehicle because his view is obstructed by the trailer, there should have counterparts of these lights on the trailer, since the trailer moves relative to the movement of your vehicle.  One of the main problems in attempting to install these lighting equipments to your vehicle is how to provide them with power.  Due to this, the electrical wiring of the towing vehicle has to be tapped.  You can easily do this, provided you have a set of Valley hitch T connectors.  There is the T One connector, and there is the T connector for you to make use of.  Whichever type you choose for the Valley hitch T connectors, you should check if it comes previously wired to a four pole flat that can be modified to fit to a six or seven way round connector.  When installing, you should be able to identify the appropriate wirings on the towing vehicle.  Check on the manual of your vehicle if you are having difficulty locating the wires.  For guaranteeing the efficiency of the signal lights attached to the trailer, trust only a genuine set of durable Valley hitch T connectors to do the job for you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

Only someone who's not in his right mind, that is! But before you can achieve more tremendous horsepower and torque, you have to be prepared to make some minor changes to your engine first. Don't worry-you won't be doing a complete overhaul of your vehicle. You just have to modify a few components to maximize your car's performance. We're all quite scared of changes, but some changes are actually good and can benefit you in the long run, like a nice haircut or a change of lifestyle. With your car, there's a brand which can help you make this certain change to your engine-the premium brand Velocity, renowned makers of aftermarket and OEM cold air intakes.</p>Restrictions usually suffocate us, right? The strict rules and regulations in school or in the office can sometimes put a chain around people's necks, making it harder for some to function and work efficiently. Giving people some breathing space is actually more helpful than restricting them with unreasonable rules. A considerable breathing space or increased airflow is also what your engine needs to be able to churn more horsepower for longer and more enduring performance. A Velocity cold air intake is designed to feed your car with cooler and denser air that is required to bring in more horsepower. Usually, each engine is fitted with stock air boxes that come with paper air filters. But instead of allowing more air to circulate around your engine parts, the stock piece actually restricts the airflow and cuts off a huge amount of potential power that can be delivered to your car.But trust Velocity to make the necessary changes to your engine. As the leading manufacturer and supplier of aftermarket cold air intake systems, the brand guarantees better airflow that can help increase fuel economy and engine efficiency. The brand also uses advanced plastics and other materials which are environmentally-friendly, truly making it a better alternative to stock air boxes.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

Its manufacturing plants currently supply over 4,000 automotive units in more than 125 countries spread across all continents. The company also develops and produces approximately 1,000 new additions to their product line each year, hence reaching a larger market share in Germany and beyond.The automobile electrics division of the brand covers an extensive range, including the Vemo crank position sensor, injection valves, lambda probes, washer jets, starters, spark plugs, wiper motors, air-mass sensors, and steering column switches, to name a few. The air-conditioning division, on the other hand, carries compressors, radiators, blower motors, cabin air filters with active carbon, fan clutches, thermostats, heat exchangers, and so much more that it basically answers all your automotive needs. But sensors are still at the brand's leading product, especially the Vemo reference sensor which is widely used in various engine parts, like in the ignition system. For failsafe sensor performance, a Vemo switch assembly is recommended. The assembly is much like a harness and a relay which connects the sensor to the engine's computer.

Sauna burns off your body's fats and helps you sweat out the internal toxins, while the summer sun makes a vacation more fun, and it also helps bring out your wife's golden tan color. But too much heat can be dangerous as well and will make you suffer from heat strokes or a badly burnt skin. It's quite the same for your engine. Heat is beneficial to some metal parts, but only in moderation since too much high temperature will most likely lead to a mechanical meltdown and costly repairs. Radiators are reliable engine parts which can help bring the heat down in your engine, and only the trusted radiator manufacturer Viscondi can ensure a total temperature change when it comes to your vehicle.</p>Radiators are also called as heat exchangers and largely contribute to the cooling process of your engine. After Franz San Galli invented the first heating radiator in the 1850's, this device has been fitted in most car models to guarantee an efficient cooling system. Internal combustion engines are the primary beneficiaries of radiators. The component does a great job of controlling the high temperature coming from the pistons, valves, and cylinders so your car's engine won't suffer from excessive heat which could lead to a total irreparable breakdown. Backed by years of automotive expertise, Viscondi produces heat-resistant radiators that are 100% durable and tough. The brand ensures each radiator manufactured can endure the extreme temperature of your engine.Failure of the radiator to operate can be blamed on the high temperature levels this part is constantly exposed to. The most common causes of failure are accidents, like front end collisions, overheating, a damaged pressure cap, rust, and solder. In case your radiator becomes a victim to one of these causes, chuck it out of the cooling system immediately before the damage could affect your engine. A Viscondi radiator is a great replacement because it is covered with tough metal coating that won't easily deteriorate even under extreme circumstances.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

To spare your vehicle body from merciless road situations, mount added protection to your ride with WAAG parts, the leading manufacturer of off-road accessory designs.</p>Wheeled Aircraft Access Gear, or simply WAAG, didn't plunge immediately into the automotive accessories business when it first started. The company was founded some 50 years ago but it wasn't an auto parts maker then. In fact, it manufactured iron and brass bedroom furniture at first. Yes, it's a far cry from the off-road accessories the brand is known for today, but the metal-working skills of the design team made it easy for the brand to enter the highly competitive world of automotive aftermarket. The famous WAAG grille guard is one of the company's first aftermarket products. It reinvented the boxy styles of older grille guards into a classier, more contoured styling. By following the lines of your vehicle's front end, the brand's grille guards provide better protection to the grilles and shield it well against collision impacts.The brand not only protects the front end of your vehicle, but also the rear part with a WAAG tail light guard. The tail light assembly is also susceptible to dents and damage especially during bumper-to-bumper traffic. But WAAG uses heavy gauge steel plates matched with extra durable protective vinyl molding to encase your tail light assembly and keep it out of harm's way. With a tail light guard, you can rest easy knowing your car's tail lights won't suddenly go dead because of stone hits and careless bumps.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

{"link": "<div itemprop=\"articleBody\" data-elemname=\"article_body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Major highway accidents were greatly reduced with the introduction of anti-lock braking systems in modern cars. This technology raises your braking system a step higher by preventing wheel lock-up during emergency road situations. If your car's not equipped with ABS, you won't be able to steer your car while trying to stop, and this glitch often results to grievous accidents. But the anti-lock braking system is such a complicated mechanism that you would need to seek the help of an expert company to ensure you'll only get the most reliable ABS components. WABCO, or Westinghouse Air Brake Company, has over 142 years of automotive expertise, most of which were focused on developing the best anti-lock braking system parts.</p>This technology is particularly useful when a child or a dog suddenly crosses the street, or if the car in front of you stops suddenly without even flashing a warning light. The ABS will help activate the brakes of your car faster and also help you avoid the running child or the immobile vehicle in front of you. The system has four main parts-speed sensors, controller, pump, and valves. The sensors determine in advance whether a wheel lock-up will happen, and this information is sent to the engine's computer for further action. Each brake line is fitted with a corresponding valve that releases brake pressure. A controller is like the CPU, or the computer box of the entire system. It keeps a close watch on the speed sensors and assists in controlling the valves. Lastly, there's the WABCO ABS pump, the part which routes the pressure back to the brakes. The brake fluid pressure is needed to engage the ABS mechanism properly.If one or more of these components fail, you will lose the capacity to brake safely during emergencies. This could put your life in danger, as well as cause major accidents on the road. It is highly recommended for you to install only WABCO parts to guarantee a failsafe system. The components from this brand ensure maximum protection against wheel lock-up, even if you're driving along slippery roads.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

{"link": "<div itemprop=\"articleBody\" data-elemname=\"article_body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Brake pads are like the superheroes of your car's braking system.

He maxed out his entire strength, but managed to stop the train and saved a lot of people in the process. Yes, that's pretty much the scene you should think of when it comes to the brake pad on your wheels so you'll be able to appreciate this part more. To apply superhero strength on your braking system, choose Wagner when replacing or upgrading your brake components. The company is the 'World Leader in Friction', and has a comprehensive line of brake pads that applies the best friction program for maximum stopping ability.</p>The brand is an expert on anything and everything that is related to a car's brake system. Rotors, drums, brake shoes, hydraulics-all of these parts are under the Wagner brake division.

You'll be able to experience the Spiderman effect whenever you engage the brakes and you'll be able to enjoy a more responsive system that reacts to even the smallest pressure from your foot.How do these brake pads work by the way? These are actually the ones responsible for creating the frictional force that is required to be able to stop your car whenever the brakes are applied. The pads are sandwiched in the middle of the brake rotors and calipers, so they're basically squeezed frequently for optimum heat and energy absorption.

{"link": "<div itemprop=\"articleBody\" data-elemname=\"article_body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Allowing the temperature in your engine to bounce back and return to normal levels is the primary function of the thermostat assembly. Apart from that, it acts as a gatekeeper and blocks the flow of the coolant to the radiator during cold start-ups. Just think of it as the gates of the ancient mythical city Troy. Nothing can pass through it unless the fortress' entrance is opened. The thermostat is very crucial in maintaining the efficient performance of your engine because it serves a dual purpose-cooling the engine when heated, and heating up the engine when it is cold. Because it plays an important role in your vehicle, you should only trust reliable brands when it comes this part. The German company Gustav Wahler GmbH produces durable thermostat assemblies and other components that are necessary for your vehicle to gain optimum temperature and exhaust gas management.</p>As a proof of its reliability when it comes to thermostat systems, Wahler was granted its first product patent in 1928, the \"Thermostatic Regulation of the Coolant Circuit of Internal Combustion Engines\". Wahler even upgraded the equipment of its Research and Development department after gaining the patent and put up an in-house bench dynamometer to better conduct research in the thermodynamics field. The Wahler thermostat assembly is fitted directly on your car's engine but it deflects the extreme temperature that is produced by the radiated engine heat because the brand only uses the most highly-resistant metal in crafting its products.Without an efficient thermostat assembly, the engine will suffer from idle starts and overheating. When the assembly fails, you can always seek the help of a Wahler auxiliary fan switch to help regulate the temperature, but it will never be enough to cool an entire machine down. Engine heat is good, but only if it's at the proper level. Too much heat can expand the metal parts drastically and this can lead to an engine breakdown, especially if the pistons become enlarged beyond necessary. But too little heat can also be detrimental to the engine parts. The pistons and rings in the combustion chamber will become loose and this could significantly reduce the performance of the vehicle.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

Weapon R Headers start with the best exhaust material made-stainless steel. Stainless steel pipes are mandrel bent into the correct shape for optimum exhaust flow and then, they're double welded to the flange. The flanges are CNC machined for a perfect fit. The stainless steel on Weapon R Headers is then given a show polish, and it also includes all necessary hardware and instructions. <br>Instead of using surgical cotton gauze like most filters, the Weapon R Air Filter uses oiled, high-density foam. The Weapon R Air Filter works a lot like a lawn mower air filter-the air passes through the foam, where oil captures it and holds it until cleaning time. This filter has up to 80 percent better airflow with cleaning ability equal to or better than conventional cotton high-flow filters. You can also customize your air filter, because it can be taken apart and the foam element replaced with one of a different color. The Dragon air filter from Weapon R features a velocity stack built in to the filter element for higher air volumes.

This can happen after a while, brought in by the constant flow of electricity through the said parts. When any of these problems happens, the operation of the entire components controlled by the relay will be affected. So, never hesitate and replace the part at once-get a Wehrle relay!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

Most car enthusiasts dedicate a lot of time customizing their vehicle by rebuilding their engine-for the reason of performance or simply pure fun. Much as this is fun, though, the process is also critical and requires sufficient experience in doing the task. You can't go wrong with the engine, because even the smallest mistake can lead to a major disaster. Even when it comes to your needed rebuild parts, you have to trust only the best. And for all your needed seals and gaskets, Wrightwood Racing is the name to remember.</p>This brand is known for offering seals, gaskets, and o-rings that are specifically crafted for engine rebuilding and for rigorous and demanding applications that require better sealing. Some of the parts that it offers are the Wrightwood Racing timing cover gasket set, Wrightwood Racing engine seal kit, and the Wrightwood Racing ST gasket set. These are great options because they are made from more durable materials. While most seals and gaskets are built from average rubber, the seals from the company are built from viton. This type of material is synthetic rubber, and it's known for its high resistance to heat, one of the most common enemies of gaskets and seals.Once you have these new parts, the next secret to getting the most out of the said components is to mount them properly. There are certain tips for getting it right when mounting. One has to do with alignment. Be sure that the part is properly aligned with the surface into which you're mounting it-alignment greatly determines the lifespan and efficiency of the gasket. Improper alignment might lead to leaks, and this can cause premature part damage. Two is the use of bolts. If you're using bolts with your Wrightwood Racing gaskets and seals, properly tighten them. Don't over-tighten, as this can put a lot of pressure on the seal and can cause damage.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},

{"link": "<div itemprop=\"articleBody\" data-elemname=\"article_body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Do you know that upgrading the brake discs in your vehicle will improve not just your braking performance but even your ride appeal? Well, it will! The brake disc is the simple metal casting that provides a clamping surface for the brake pads to make friction production possible. This is the actual action that brings your vehicle to a complete stop. But, if you're planning of a disc upgrade, your new knowledge will help you hit two birds with one stone in your disc purchase. Entrust all your needs to Zimmermann Cross Drilled!</p>This company offers a selection of brake discs for a wide array of car makes and models. It offers discs made from strong materials, and it incorporates efficient designs into its products-for the reason of both appeal and function. One of its parts is the Zimmermann Cross Drilled brake disc. As the brand name states, many of the discs offered by the company come with cross-drilled holes. First and foremost, these holes make the disc visually appealing. Once mounted in place and seen beneath the wheels, the effects can be head-turning. And when you add in the shine in these discs, you get a complete look upgrade. These discs, however, are more than just appeal. The drilled holes in the disc are actually helpful in dissipating all the heat that is produced when braking. This prevents heat buildup, which often results in damage such as disc cracking.Other than cross drilling, another brake disc design that you may get interested in is the incorporation of slots. This also improves brake disc appearance. But, more than that, this helps maximize contact between the brake pads and the disc. How? Well, the slots accommodate the brake dust that would have settled either on the disc or pad surface, reducing contact between the two parts. With the slots, the brake dust is taken out of the picture and maximum contact is achieved, thereby producing a maximum amount of friction. All these benefits, you can get from Zimmermann Cross Drilled parts.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>"},
